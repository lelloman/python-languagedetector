she had done it again instead of coming straight home from school like she was supposed to she had gone to her friends house without permission without our knowledge without doing her chores with a ministering household that included remnants of three struggling families plus our own toddler and newborn my wife simply couldnt handle all the work on her own everyone had to pull their own weight everyone had ageappropriate tasks they were expected to complete at fourteen rachel and her younger brother were living with us while her parents tried to overcome lifestyle patterns that had resulted in the children running away to escape the dysfunction i felt sorry for rachel but honestly my wife was my greatest concern now rachel had ditched her chores to spend time with her friends it wasnt the first time but if i had anything to say about it it would be the last i intended to lay down the law when she got home and make it very clear that if she was going to live under my roof she would obey my rules butshe wasnt home yet and i had recently been learning to hear gods voice more clearly maybe i should try to see if i could hear anything from him about the situation maybe he could give me a way to get her to do what she was supposed to ie what i wanted her to do so i went to my office and reviewed what the lord had been teaching me from habakkuk i will stand on my guard post and station myself on the rampart and i will keep watch to see what he will speak to methen the lord answered me and said record the vision habakkuk said i will stand on my guard post hab the first key to hearing god's voice is to go to a quiet place and still our own thoughts and emotions psalm encourages us to be still let go cease striving and know that he is god in psalm we are called to be still before the lord and wait patiently for him there is a deep inner knowing in our spirits that each of us can experience when we quiet our flesh and our minds practicing the art of biblical meditation helps silence the outer noise and distractions clamoring for our attention i didnt have a guard post but i did have an office so i went there to quiet my temper and my mind loving god through a quiet worship song is one very effective way to become still in kings elisha needed a word from the lord so he said bring me a minstrel and as the minstrel played the lord spoke i have found that playing a worship song on my autoharp is the quickest way for me to come to stillness i need to choose my song carefully boisterous songs of praise do not bring me to stillness but rather gentle songs that express my love and worship and it isnt enough just to sing the song into the cosmos i come into the lords presence most quickly and easily when i use my godly imagination to see the truth that he is right here with me and i sing my songs to him personally i will keep watch to see said the prophet to receive the pure word of god it is very important that my heart be properly focused as i become still because my focus is the source of the intuitive flow if i fix my eyes upon jesus heb the intuitive flow comes from jesus but if i fix my gaze upon some desire of my heart the intuitive flow comes out of that desire to have a pure flow i must become still and carefully fix my eyes upon jesus quietly worshiping the king and receiving out of the stillness that follows quite easily accomplishes this so i used the second key to hearing gods voice as you pray fix the eyes of your heart upon jesus seeing in the spirit the dreams and visions of almighty god habakkuk was actually looking for vision as he prayed he opened the eyes of his heart and looked into the spirit world to see what god wanted to show him god has always spoken through dreams and visions and he specifically said that they would come to those upon whom the holy spirit is poured out acts being a logical rational person observable facts that could be verified by my physical senses were the foundations of my life including my spiritual life i had never thought of opening the eyes of my heart and looking for vision however i have come to believe that this is exactly what god wants me to do he gave me eyes in my heart to see in the spirit the vision and movement of almighty god there is an active spirit world all around us full of angels demons the holy spirit the omnipresent father and his omnipresent son jesus the only reasons for me not to see this reality are unbelief or lack of knowledge in his sermon in acts peter refers to king davids statement i saw the lord always in my presence for he is at my right hand so that i will not be shaken the original psalm makes it clear that this was a decision of davids not a constant supernatural visitation i have set literally i have placed the lord continually before me because he is at my right hand i will not be shaken ps because david knew that the lord was always with him he determined in his spirit to see that truth with the eyes of his heart as he went through life knowing that this would keep his faith strong in order to see we must look daniel saw a vision in his mind and said i was lookingi kept lookingi kept looking dan as i pray i look for jesus and i watch as he speaks to me doing and saying the things that are on his heart many christians will find that if they will only look they will see jesus is emmanuel god with us matt it is as simple as that you can see christ present with you because christ is present with you in fact the vision may come so easily that you will be tempted to reject it thinking that it is just you but if you persist in recording these visions your doubt will soon be overcome by faith as you recognize that the content of them could only be birthed in almighty god jesus demonstrated the ability of living out of constant contact with god declaring that he did nothing on his own initiative but only what he saw the father doing and heard the father saying jn what an incredible way to live is it possible for us to live out of divine initiative as jesus did yes we must simply fix our eyes upon jesus the veil has been torn giving access into the immediate presence of god and he calls us to draw near lk heb i pray that the eyes of your heart will be enlightened when i had quieted my heart enough that i was able to picture jesus without the distractions of my own ideas and plans i was able to keep watch to see what he will speak to me i wrote down my question lord what should i do about rachel immediately the thought came to me she is insecure well that certainly wasnt my thought her behavior looked like rebellion to me not insecurity but like habakkuk i was coming to know the sound of god speaking to me hab elijah described it as a still small voice i kings i had previously listened for an inner audible voice and god does speak that way at times however i have found that usually god's voice comes as spontaneous thoughts visions feelings or impressions for example haven't you been driving down the road and had a thought come to you to pray for a certain person didnt you believe it was god telling you to pray what did god's voice sound like was it an audible voice or was it a spontaneous thought that lit upon your mind experience indicates that we perceive spiritlevel communication as spontaneous thoughts impressions and visions and scripture confirms this in many ways for example one definition of paga a hebrew word for intercession is a chance encounter or an accidental intersecting when god lays people on our hearts he does it through paga a chanceencounter thought accidentally intersecting our minds so the third key to hearing gods voice is recognizing that god's voice in your heart often sounds like a flow of spontaneous thoughts therefore when i want to hear from god i tune to chanceencounter or spontaneous thoughts finally god told habakkuk to record the vision hab this was not an isolated command the scriptures record many examples of individuals prayers and gods replies such as the psalms many of the prophets and revelation i have found that obeying this final principle amplified my confidence in my ability to hear gods voice so that i could finally make living out of his initiatives a way of life the fourth key twoway journaling or the writing out of your prayers and gods answers brings great freedom in hearing gods voice i have found twoway journaling to be a fabulous catalyst for clearly discerning god's inner spontaneous flow because as i journal i am able to write in faith for long periods of time simply believing it is god i know that what i believe i have received from god must be tested however testing involves doubt and doubt blocks divine communication so i do not want to test while i am trying to receive see james with journaling i can receive in faith knowing that when the flow has ended i can test and examine it carefully so i wrote down what i believed he had said she is insecure but the lord wasnt done i continued to write the spontaneous thoughts that came to me love her unconditionally she is flesh of your flesh and bone of your bone my mind immediately objected she is not flesh of my flesh she is not related to me at all she is a foster child just living in my home temporarily it was definitely time to test this word from the lord there are three possible sources of thoughts in our minds ourselves satan and the holy spirit it was obvious that the words in my journal did not come from my own mind i certainly didnt see her as insecure or flesh of my flesh and i sincerely doubted that satan would encourage me to love anyone unconditionally okay it was starting to look like i might have actually received counsel from the lord it was consistent with the names and character of god as revealed in the scripture and totally contrary to the names and character of the enemy so that meant that i was hearing from the lord and he wanted me to see the situation in a different light rachel was my daughter part of my family not by blood but by the hand of god himself the chaos of her birth home had created deep insecurity about her worthiness to be loved by anyone including me and including god only the unconditional love of the lord expressed through an imperfect human would reach her heart but there was still one more test i needed to perform before i would have absolute confidence that this was truly gods word to me i needed confirmation from someone else whose spiritual discernment i trusted so i went to my wife and shared what i had received i knew if i could get her validation especially since she was the one most wronged in the situation then i could say at least to myself thus sayeth the lord needless to say patti immediately and without question confirmed that the lord had spoken to me my entire planned lecture was forgotten i returned to my office anxious to hear more as the lord planted a new supernatural love for rachel within me he showed me what to say and how to say it to not only address the current issue of household responsibility but the deeper issues of love and acceptance and worthiness rachel and her brother remained as part of our family for another two years giving us many opportunities to demonstrate and teach about the fathers love planting spiritual seeds in thirsty soil we werent perfect and we didnt solve all of her issues but because i had learned to listen to the lord we were able to avoid creating more brokenness and separation the four simple keys that the lord showed me from habakkuk have been used by people of all ages from four to a hundred and four from every continent culture and denomination to break through into intimate twoway conversations with their loving father and dearest friend omitting any one of the keys will prevent you from receiving all he wants to say to you the order of the keys is not important just that you use them all embracing all four by faith can change your life simply quiet yourself down tune to spontaneity look for vision and journal he is waiting to meet you there you will be amazed when you journal doubt may hinder you at first but throw it off reminding yourself that it is a biblical concept and that god is present speaking to his children relax when we cease our labors and enter his rest god is free to flow whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom justice and peace in the world whereas disregard and contempt for human rights have resulted in barbarous acts which have outraged the conscience of mankind and the advent of a world in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech and belief and freedom from fear and want
