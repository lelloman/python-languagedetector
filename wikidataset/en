agriculture is the cultivation and breeding of animals, plants and fungi for food, fiber, biofuel, medicinal plants and other products used to sustain and enhance human life. agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization, whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that nurtured the development of civilization. the study of agriculture is known as agricultural science. the history of agriculture dates back thousands of years, and its development has been driven and defined by greatly different climates, cultures, and technologies. industrial agriculture based on large-scale monoculture farming has become the dominant agricultural methodology.
modern agronomy, plant breeding, agrochemicals such as pesticides and fertilizers, and technological developments have in many cases sharply increased yields from cultivation, but at the same time have caused widespread ecological damage and negative human health effects. selective breeding and modern practices in animal husbandry have similarly increased the output of meat, but have raised concerns about animal welfare and the health effects of the antibiotics, growth hormones, and other chemicals commonly used in industrial meat production. genetically modified organisms are an increasing component of agriculture, although they are banned in several countries. agricultural food production and water management are increasingly becoming global issues that are fostering debate on a number of fronts. significant degradation of land and water resources, including the depletion of aquifers, has been observed in recent decades, and the effects of global warming on agriculture and of agriculture on global warming are still not fully understood.
the major agricultural products can be broadly grouped into foods, fibers, fuels, and raw materials. specific foods include cereals (grains), vegetables, fruits, oils, meats and spices. fibers include cotton, wool, hemp, silk and flax. raw materials include lumber and bamboo. other useful materials are also produced by plants, such as resins, dyes, drugs, perfumes, biofuels and ornamental products such as cut flowers and nursery plants. over one third of the world's workers are employed in agriculture, second only to the service sector, although the percentages of agricultural workers in developed countries has decreased significantly over the past several centuries. etymology and terminology the word agriculture is a late middle english adaptation of latin agricultūra, from ager, field, and cultūra, cultivation or growing. agriculture usually refers to human activities, although it is also observed in certain species of ant, termite and ambrosia beetle. to practice agriculture means to use natural resources to produce commodities which maintain life, including food, fiber, forest products, horticultural crops, and their related services. this definition includes arable farming or agronomy, and horticulture, all terms for the growing of plants, animal husbandry and forestry. a distinction is sometimes made between forestry and agriculture, based on the former's longer management rotations, extensive versus intensive management practices and development mainly by nature, rather than by man. even then, it is acknowledged that there is a large amount of knowledge transfer and overlap between silviculture (the management of forests) and agriculture. in traditional farming, the two are often combined even on small landholdings, leading to the term agroforestry. history agriculture began independently in different parts of the globe, and included a diverse range of taxa. at least 11 separate regions of the old and new world were involved as independent centers of origin. wild grains were collected and eaten from at least 105,000 years ago. pigs were domesticated in mesopotamia around 15,000 years ago. rice was domesticated in china between 13,500 and 8,200 years ago, followed by mung, soy and azuki beans. sheep were domesticated in mesopotamia between 13,000 and 11,000 years ago. from around 11,500 years ago, the eight neolithic founder crops, emmer and einkorn wheat, hulled barley, peas, lentils, bitter vetch, chick peas and flax were cultivated in the levant. cattle were domesticated from the wild aurochs in the areas of modern turkey and pakistan some 10,500 years ago. in the andes of south america, the potato was domesticated between 10,000 and 7,000 years ago, along with beans, coca, llamas, alpacas, and guinea pigs. sugarcane and some root vegetables were domesticated in new guinea around 9,000 years ago. sorghum was domesticated in the sahel region of africa by 7,000 years ago. cotton was domesticated in peru by 5,600 years ago, and was independently domesticated in eurasia at an unknown time. in mesoamerica, wild teosinte was domesticated to maize by 6,000 years ago.
in the middle ages, both in the islamic world and in europe, agriculture was transformed with improved techniques and the diffusion of crop plants, including the introduction of sugar, rice, cotton and fruit trees such as the orange to europe by way of al-andalus. after 1492, the columbian exchange brought new world crops such as maize, potatoes, sweet potatoes and manioc to europe, and old world crops such as wheat, barley, rice and turnips, and livestock including horses, cattle, sheep and goats to the americas. irrigation, crop rotation, and fertilizers were introduced soon after the neolithic revolution and developed much further in the past 200 years, starting with the british agricultural revolution. since 1900, agriculture in the developed nations, and to a lesser extent in the developing world, has seen large rises in productivity as human labor has been replaced by mechanization, and assisted by synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and selective breeding. the haber-bosch method allowed the synthesis of ammonium nitrate fertilizer on an industrial scale, greatly increasing crop yields. modern agriculture has raised political issues including water pollution, biofuels, genetically modified organisms, tariffs and farm subsidies, leading to alternative approaches such as the organic movement and regenerative agriculture. agriculture and civilization civilization was the product of the agricultural neolithic revolution; as h. g. wells put it, civilization was the agricultural surplus. in the course of history, civilization coincided in space with fertile areas such as the fertile crescent, and states formed mainly in circumscribed agricultural lands. the great wall of china and the roman empire's limes (borders) demarcated the same northern frontier of cereal agriculture. this cereal belt fed the civilizations formed in the axial age and connected by the silk road.
ancient egyptians, whose agriculture depended exclusively on the nile, deified the river, worshipped, and exalted it in a great hymn. the chinese imperial court issued numerous edicts, stating: agriculture is the foundation of this empire. egyptian, mesopotamian, chinese, and inca emperors themselves plowed ceremonial fields in order to show personal example to everyone.
ancient strategists, chinese guan zhong and shang yang and indian kautilya, drew doctrines linking agriculture with military power. agriculture defined the limits on how large and for how long an army could be mobilized. shang yang called agriculture and war the one. in the vast human pantheon of agricultural deities there are several deities who combined the functions of agriculture and war.
as the neolithic agricultural revolution produced civilization, the modern agricultural revolution, begun in britain (british agricultural revolution), made possible the industrial civilization. the first precondition for industry was greater yields by less manpower, resulting in greater percentage of manpower available for non-agricultural sectors. types of agriculture pastoralism involves managing domesticated animals. in nomadic pastoralism, herds of livestock are moved from place to place in search of pasture, fodder, and water. this type of farming is practised in arid and semi-arid regions of sahara, central asia and some parts of india.
in shifting cultivation, a small area of a forest is cleared by cutting down all the trees and the area is burned. the land is then used for growing crops for several years. when the soil becomes less fertile, the area is then abandoned. another patch of land is selected and the process is repeated. this type of farming is practiced mainly in areas with abundant rainfall where the forest regenerates quickly. this practice is used in northeast india, southeast asia, and the amazon basin.
subsistence farming is practiced to satisfy family or local needs alone, with little left over for transport elsewhere. it is intensively practiced in monsoon asia and south-east asia.
in intensive farming, the crops are cultivated for commercial purpose i.e., for selling. the main motive of the farmer is to make profit, with a low fallow ratio and a high use of inputs. this type of farming is mainly practiced in highly developed countries. contemporary agriculture in the past century, agriculture has been characterized by increased productivity, the substitution of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides for labor, water pollution, and farm subsidies. in recent years there has been a backlash against the external environmental effects of conventional agriculture, resulting in the organic, regenerative, and sustainable agriculture movements. one of the major forces behind this movement has been the european union, which first certified organic food in 1991 and began reform of its common agricultural policy (cap) in 2005 to phase out commodity-linked farm subsidies, also known as decoupling. the growth of organic farming has renewed research in alternative technologies such as integrated pest management and selective breeding. recent mainstream technological developments include genetically modified food.
in 2007, higher incentives for farmers to grow non-food biofuel crops combined with other factors, such as over development of former farm lands, rising transportation costs, climate change, growing consumer demand in china and india, and population growth, caused food shortages in asia, the middle east, africa, and mexico, as well as rising food prices around the globe. as of december 2007, 37 countries faced food crises, and 20 had imposed some sort of food-price controls. some of these shortages resulted in food riots and even deadly stampedes. the international fund for agricultural development posits that an increase in smallholder agriculture may be part of the solution to concerns about food prices and overall food security. they in part base this on the experience of vietnam, which went from a food importer to large food exporter and saw a significant drop in poverty, due mainly to the development of smallholder agriculture in the country.
disease and land degradation are two of the major concerns in agriculture today. for example, an epidemic of stem rust on wheat caused by the ug99 lineage is currently spreading across africa and into asia and is causing major concerns due to crop losses of 70% or more under some conditions. approximately 40% of the world's agricultural land is seriously degraded. in africa, if current trends of soil degradation continue, the continent might be able to feed just 25% of its population by 2025, according to united nations university's ghana-based institute for natural resources in africa.
agrarian structure is a long-term structure in the braudelian understanding of the concept. on a larger scale the agrarian structure is more dependent on the regional, social, cultural and historical factors than on the state’s undertaken activities. like in poland, where despite running an intense agrarian policy for many years, the agrarian structure in 2002 has much in common with that found in 1921 soon after the partitions period.
in 2009, the agricultural output of china was the largest in the world, followed by the european union, india and the united states, according to the international monetary fund (see below). economists measure the total factor productivity of agriculture and by this measure agriculture in the united states is roughly 1.7 times more productive than it was in 1948. workforce as of 2011, the international labour organization states that approximately one billion people, or over 1/3 of the available work force, are employed in the global agricultural sector. agriculture constitutes approximately 70% of the global employment of children, and in many countries employs the largest percentage of women of any industry. the service sector only overtook the agricultural sector as the largest global employer in 2007. between 1997 and 2007, the percentage of people employed in agriculture fell by over four percentage points, a trend that is expected to continue. the number of people employed in agriculture varies widely on a per-country basis, ranging from less than 2% in countries like the us and canada to over 80% in many african nations. in developed countries, these figures are significantly lower than in previous centuries. during the 16th century in europe, for example, between 55 and 75 percent of the population was engaged in agriculture, depending on the country. by the 19th century in europe, this had dropped to between 35 and 65 percent. in the same countries today, the figure is less than 10%. safety agriculture, specifically farming, remains a hazardous industry, and farmers worldwide remain at high risk of work-related injuries, lung disease, noise-induced hearing loss, skin diseases, as well as certain cancers related to chemical use and prolonged sun exposure. on industrialized farms, injuries frequently involve the use of agricultural machinery, and a common cause of fatal agricultural injuries in developed countries is tractor rollovers. pesticides and other chemicals used in farming can also be hazardous to worker health, and workers exposed to pesticides may experience illness or have children with birth defects. as an industry in which families commonly share in work and live on the farm itself, entire families can be at risk for injuries, illness, and death. common causes of fatal injuries among young farm workers include drowning, machinery and motor vehicle-related accidents.
the international labour organization considers agriculture one of the most hazardous of all economic sectors. it estimates that the annual work-related death toll among agricultural employees is at least 170,000, twice the average rate of other jobs. in addition, incidences of death, injury and illness related to agricultural activities often go unreported. the organization has developed the safety and health in agriculture convention, 2001, which covers the range of risks in the agriculture occupation, the prevention of these risks and the role that individuals and organizations engaged in agriculture should play. agricultural production systems crop cultivation systems cropping systems vary among farms depending on the available resources and constraints; geography and climate of the farm; government policy; economic, social and political pressures; and the philosophy and culture of the farmer.
shifting cultivation (or slash and burn) is a system in which forests are burnt, releasing nutrients to support cultivation of annual and then perennial crops for a period of several years. then the plot is left fallow to regrow forest, and the farmer moves to a new plot, returning after many more years (10–20). this fallow period is shortened if population density grows, requiring the input of nutrients (fertilizer or manure) and some manual pest control. annual cultivation is the next phase of intensity in which there is no fallow period. this requires even greater nutrient and pest control inputs.
further industrialization led to the use of monocultures, when one cultivar is planted on a large acreage. because of the low biodiversity, nutrient use is uniform and pests tend to build up, necessitating the greater use of pesticides and fertilizers. multiple cropping, in which several crops are grown sequentially in one year, and intercropping, when several crops are grown at the same time, are other kinds of annual cropping systems known as polycultures.
in subtropical and arid environments, the timing and extent of agriculture may be limited by rainfall, either not allowing multiple annual crops in a year, or requiring irrigation. in all of these environments perennial crops are grown (coffee, chocolate) and systems are practiced such as agroforestry. in temperate environments, where ecosystems were predominantly grassland or prairie, highly productive annual farming is the dominant agricultural system. crop statistics important categories of crops include cereals and pseudocereals, pulses (legumes), forage, and fruits and vegetables. specific crops are cultivated in distinct growing regions throughout the world. in millions of metric tons, based on fao estimate. livestock production systems animals, including horses, mules, oxen, water buffalo, camels, llamas, alpacas, donkeys, and dogs, are often used to help cultivate fields, harvest crops, wrangle other animals, and transport farm products to buyers. animal husbandry not only refers to the breeding and raising of animals for meat or to harvest animal products (like milk, eggs, or wool) on a continual basis, but also to the breeding and care of species for work and companionship. livestock production systems can be defined based on feed source, as grassland-based, mixed, and landless. as of 2010, 30% of earth's ice- and water-free area was used for producing livestock, with the sector employing approximately 1.3 billion people. between the 1960s and the 2000s, there was a significant increase in livestock production, both by numbers and by carcass weight, especially among beef, pigs and chickens, the latter of which had production increased by almost a factor of 10. non-meat animals, such as milk cows and egg-producing chickens, also showed significant production increases. global cattle, sheep and goat populations are expected to continue to increase sharply through 2050. aquaculture or fish farming, the production of fish for human consumption in confined operations, is one of the fastest growing sectors of food production, growing at an average of 9% a year between 1975 and 2007.
during the second half of the 20th century, producers using selective breeding focused on creating livestock breeds and crossbreeds that increased production, while mostly disregarding the need to preserve genetic diversity. this trend has led to a significant decrease in genetic diversity and resources among livestock breeds, leading to a corresponding decrease in disease resistance and local adaptations previously found among traditional breeds.
grassland based livestock production relies upon plant material such as shrubland, rangeland, and pastures for feeding ruminant animals. outside nutrient inputs may be used, however manure is returned directly to the grassland as a major nutrient source. this system is particularly important in areas where crop production is not feasible because of climate or soil, representing 30–40 million pastoralists. mixed production systems use grassland, fodder crops and grain feed crops as feed for ruminant and monogastric (one stomach; mainly chickens and pigs) livestock. manure is typically recycled in mixed systems as a fertilizer for crops.
landless systems rely upon feed from outside the farm, representing the de-linking of crop and livestock production found more prevalently in organisation for economic co-operation and development(oecd) member countries. synthetic fertilizers are more heavily relied upon for crop production and manure utilization becomes a challenge as well as a source for pollution. industrialized countries use these operations to produce much of the global supplies of poultry and pork. scientists estimate that 75% of the growth in livestock production between 2003 and 2030 will be in confined animal feeding operations, sometimes called factory farming. much of this growth is happening in developing countries in asia, with much smaller amounts of growth in africa. some of the practices used in commercial livestock production, including the usage of growth hormones, are controversial. production practices farming is the practice of agriculture by specialized labor in an area primarily devoted to agricultural processes, in service of a dislocated population usually in a city.
tillage is the practice of plowing soil to prepare for planting or for nutrient incorporation or for pest control. tillage varies in intensity from conventional to no-till. it may improve productivity by warming the soil, incorporating fertilizer and controlling weeds, but also renders soil more prone to erosion, triggers the decomposition of organic matter releasing co2, and reduces the abundance and diversity of soil organisms.
pest control includes the management of weeds, insects, mites, and diseases. chemical (pesticides), biological (biocontrol), mechanical (tillage), and cultural practices are used. cultural practices include crop rotation, culling, cover crops, intercropping, composting, avoidance, and resistance. integrated pest management attempts to use all of these methods to keep pest populations below the number which would cause economic loss, and recommends pesticides as a last resort.
nutrient management includes both the source of nutrient inputs for crop and livestock production, and the method of utilization of manure produced by livestock. nutrient inputs can be chemical inorganic fertilizers, manure, green manure, compost and mined minerals. crop nutrient use may also be managed using cultural techniques such as crop rotation or a fallow period. manure is used either by holding livestock where the feed crop is growing, such as in managed intensive rotational grazing, or by spreading either dry or liquid formulations of manure on cropland or pastures.
water management is needed where rainfall is insufficient or variable, which occurs to some degree in most regions of the world. some farmers use irrigation to supplement rainfall. in other areas such as the great plains in the u.s. and canada, farmers use a fallow year to conserve soil moisture to use for growing a crop in the following year. agriculture represents 70% of freshwater use worldwide.
according to a report by the international food policy research institute, agricultural technologies will have the greatest impact on food production if adopted in combination with each other; using a model that assessed how eleven technologies could impact agricultural productivity, food security and trade by 2050, the international food policy research institute found that the number of people at risk from hunger could be reduced by as much as 40% and food prices could be reduced by almost half.
payment for ecosystem services (pes) can further incentivise efforts to green the agriculture sector. this is an approach that verifies values and rewards the benefits of ecosystem services provided by green agricultural practices. innovative pes measures could include reforestation payments made by cities to upstream communities in rural areas of shared watersheds for improved quantities and quality of fresh water for municipal users. ecoservice payments by farmers to upstream forest stewards for properly managing the flow of soil nutrients, and methods to monetise the carbon sequestration and emission reduction credit benefits of green agriculture practices in order to compensate farmers for their efforts to restore and build som and employ other practices. crop alteration and biotechnology crop alteration has been practiced by humankind for thousands of years, since the beginning of civilization. altering crops through breeding practices changes the genetic make-up of a plant to develop crops with more beneficial characteristics for humans, for example, larger fruits or seeds, drought-tolerance, or resistance to pests. significant advances in plant breeding ensued after the work of geneticist gregor mendel. his work on dominant and recessive alleles, although initially largely ignored for almost 50 years, gave plant breeders a better understanding of genetics and breeding techniques. crop breeding includes techniques such as plant selection with desirable traits, self-pollination and cross-pollination, and molecular techniques that genetically modify the organism.
domestication of plants has, over the centuries increased yield, improved disease resistance and drought tolerance, eased harvest and improved the taste and nutritional value of crop plants. careful selection and breeding have had enormous effects on the characteristics of crop plants. plant selection and breeding in the 1920s and 1930s improved pasture (grasses and clover) in new zealand. extensive x-ray and ultraviolet induced mutagenesis efforts (i.e. primitive genetic engineering) during the 1950s produced the modern commercial varieties of grains such as wheat, corn (maize) and barley.
the green revolution popularized the use of conventional hybridization to sharply increase yield by creating high-yielding varieties. for example, average yields of corn (maize) in the usa have increased from around 2.5 tons per hectare (t/ha) (40 bushels per acre) in 1900 to about 9.4 t/ha (150 bushels per acre) in 2001. similarly, worldwide average wheat yields have increased from less than 1 t/ha in 1900 to more than 2.5 t/ha in 1990. south american average wheat yields are around 2 t/ha, african under 1 t/ha, and egypt and arabia up to 3.5 to 4 t/ha with irrigation. in contrast, the average wheat yield in countries such as france is over 8 t/ha. variations in yields are due mainly to variation in climate, genetics, and the level of intensive farming techniques (use of fertilizers, chemical pest control, growth control to avoid lodging). genetic engineering genetically modified organisms (gmo) are organisms whose genetic material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as recombinant dna technology. genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. for some, gmo crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns. numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of gmo foods and crops, which have been put in place due to concerns over potential health issues, declining agricultural diversity and contamination of non-gmo crops. currently a global treaty, the biosafety protocol, regulates the trade of gmos. there is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from gmos, and while the eu currently requires all gmo foods to be labeled, the us does not.
herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including glyphosates. these seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide. with the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. in some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides. some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern, with potential economic and health implications.
other gmo crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium bacillus thuringiensis (bt), which produces a toxin specific to insects. these crops protect plants from damage by insects. some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination with wild species. in some cases, wild species are the primary source of resistance traits; some tomato cultivars that have gained resistance to at least 19 diseases did so through crossing with wild populations of tomatoes. environmental impact agriculture, as implemented through the method of farming, imposes external costs upon society through pesticides, nutrient runoff, excessive water usage, loss of natural environment and assorted other problems. a 2000 assessment of agriculture in the uk determined total external costs for 1996 of £2,343 million, or £208 per hectare. a 2005 analysis of these costs in the usa concluded that cropland imposes approximately $5 to 16 billion ($30 to $96 per hectare), while livestock production imposes $714 million. both studies, which focused solely on the fiscal impacts, concluded that more should be done to internalize external costs. neither included subsidies in their analysis, but they noted that subsidies also influence the cost of agriculture to society. in 2010, the international resource panel of the united nations environment programme published a report assessing the environmental impacts of consumption and production. the study found that agriculture and food consumption are two of the most important drivers of environmental pressures, particularly habitat change, climate change, water use and toxic emissions. the 2011 unep green economy report states that [a]gricultural operations, excluding land use changes, produce approximately 13 per cent of anthropogenic global ghg emissions. this includes ghgs emitted by the use of inorganic fertilisers agro-chemical pesticides and herbicides; (ghg emissions resulting from production of these inputs are included in industrial emissions); and fossil fuel-energy inputs. on average we find that the total amount of fresh residues from agricultural and forestry production for second- generation biofuel production amounts to 3.8 billion tonnes per year between 2011 and 2050 (with an average annual growth rate of 11 per cent throughout the period analysed, accounting for higher growth during early years, 48 per cent for 2011–2020 and an average 2 per cent annual expansion after 2020). livestock issues a senior un official and co-author of a un report detailing this problem, henning steinfeld, said livestock are one of the most significant contributors to today's most serious environmental problems. livestock production occupies 70% of all land used for agriculture, or 30% of the land surface of the planet. it is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gases, responsible for 18% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions as measured in co2 equivalents. by comparison, all transportation emits 13.5% of the co2. it produces 65% of human-related nitrous oxide (which has 296 times the global warming potential of co2,) and 37% of all human-induced methane (which is 23 times as warming as co2.) it also generates 64% of the ammonia emission. livestock expansion is cited as a key factor driving deforestation; in the amazon basin 70% of previously forested area is now occupied by pastures and the remainder used for feedcrops. through deforestation and land degradation, livestock is also driving reductions in biodiversity. furthermore, the unep states that methane emissions from global livestock are projected to increase by 60 per cent by 2030 under current practices and consumption patterns. land and water issues land transformation, the use of land to yield goods and services, is the most substantial way humans alter the earth's ecosystems, and is considered the driving force in the loss of biodiversity. estimates of the amount of land transformed by humans vary from 39 to 50%. land degradation, the long-term decline in ecosystem function and productivity, is estimated to be occurring on 24% of land worldwide, with cropland overrepresented. the un-fao report cites land management as the driving factor behind degradation and reports that 1.5 billion people rely upon the degrading land. degradation can be deforestation, desertification, soil erosion, mineral depletion, or chemical degradation (acidification and salinization).
eutrophication, excessive nutrients in aquatic ecosystems resulting in algal blooms and anoxia, leads to fish kills, loss of biodiversity, and renders water unfit for drinking and other industrial uses. excessive fertilization and manure application to cropland, as well as high livestock stocking densities cause nutrient (mainly nitrogen and phosphorus) runoff and leaching from agricultural land. these nutrients are major nonpoint pollutants contributing to eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems.
agriculture accounts for 70 percent of withdrawals of freshwater resources. agriculture is a major draw on water from aquifers, and currently draws from those underground water sources at an unsustainable rate. it is long known that aquifers in areas as diverse as northern china, the upper ganges and the western us are being depleted, and new research extends these problems to aquifers in iran, mexico and saudi arabia. increasing pressure is being placed on water resources by industry and urban areas, meaning that water scarcity is increasing and agriculture is facing the challenge of producing more food for the world's growing population with reduced water resources. agricultural water usage can also cause major environmental problems, including the destruction of natural wetlands, the spread of water-borne diseases, and land degradation through salinization and waterlogging, when irrigation is performed incorrectly. pesticides pesticide use has increased since 1950 to 2.5 million short tons annually worldwide, yet crop loss from pests has remained relatively constant. the world health organization estimated in 1992 that 3 million pesticide poisonings occur annually, causing 220,000 deaths. pesticides select for pesticide resistance in the pest population, leading to a condition termed the pesticide treadmill in which pest resistance warrants the development of a new pesticide.
an alternative argument is that the way to save the environment and prevent famine is by using pesticides and intensive high yield farming, a view exemplified by a quote heading the center for global food issues website: 'growing more per acre leaves more land for nature'. however, critics argue that a trade-off between the environment and a need for food is not inevitable, and that pesticides simply replace good agronomic practices such as crop rotation. the unep introduces the push–pull agricultural pest management technique which involves intercropping that uses plant aromas to repel or push away pests while pulling in or attracting the right insects. the implementation of push-pull in eastern africa has significantly increased maize yields and the combined cultivation of n-fixing forage crops has enriched the soil and has also provided farmers with feed for livestock. with increased livestock operations, the farmers are able to produce meat, milk and other dairy products and they use the manure as organic fertiliser that returns nutrients to the fields. climate change climate change has the potential to affect agriculture through changes in temperature, rainfall (timing and quantity), co2, solar radiation and the interaction of these elements. extreme events, such as droughts and floods, are forecast to increase as climate change takes hold. agriculture is among sectors most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change; water supply for example, will be critical to sustain agricultural production and provide the increase in food output required to sustain the world's growing population. fluctuations in the flow of rivers are likely to increase in the twenty-first century. based on the experience of countries in the nile river basin (ethiopia, kenya and sudan) and other developing countries, depletion of water resources during seasons crucial for agriculture can lead to a decline in yield by up to 50%. transformational approaches will be needed to manage natural resources in the future. for example, policies, practices and tools promoting climate-smart agriculture will be important, as will better use of scientific information on climate for assessing risks and vulnerability. planners and policy-makers will need to help create suitable policies that encourage funding for such agricultural transformation.
agriculture in its many forms can both mitigate or worsen global warming. some of the increase in co2 in the atmosphere comes from the decomposition of organic matter in the soil, and much of the methane emitted into the atmosphere is caused by the decomposition of organic matter in wet soils such as rice paddy fields, as well as the normal digestive activities of farm animals. further, wet or anaerobic soils also lose nitrogen through denitrification, releasing the greenhouse gases nitric oxide and nitrous oxide. changes in management can reduce the release of these greenhouse gases, and soil can further be used to sequester some of the co2 in the atmosphere. informed by the unep, [a]griculture also produces about 58 per cent of global nitrous oxide emissions and about 47 per cent of global methane emissions. cattle and rice farms release methane, fertilized fields release nitrous oxide, and the cutting down of rainforests to grow crops or raise livestock releases carbon dioxide. both of these gases have a far greater global warming potential per tonne than co2 (298 times and 25 times respectively).
there are several factors within the field of agriculture that contribute to the large amount of co2 emissions. the diversity of the sources ranges from the production of farming tools to the transport of harvested produce. approximately 8% of the national carbon footprint is due to agricultural sources. of that, 75% is of the carbon emissions released from the production of crop assisting chemicals. factories producing insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, and fertilizers are a major culprit of the greenhouse gas. productivity on the farm itself and the use of machinery is another source of the carbon emission. almost all the industrial machines used in modern farming are powered by fossil fuels. these instruments are burning fossil fuels from the beginning of the process to the end. tractors are the root of this source. the tractor is going to burn fuel and release co2 just to run. the amount of emissions from the machinery increase with the attachment of different units and need for more power. during the soil preparation stage tillers and plows will be used to disrupt the soil. during growth watering pumps and sprayers are used to keep the crops hydrated. and when the crops are ready for picking a forage or combine harvester is used. these types of machinery all require additional energy which leads to increased carbon dioxide emissions from the basic tractors. the final major contribution to co2 emissions in agriculture is in the final transport of produce. local farming suffered a decline over the past century due to large amounts of farm subsidies. the majority of crops are shipped hundreds of miles to various processing plants before ending up in the grocery store. these shipments are made using fossil fuel burning modes of transportation. inevitably these transport adds to carbon dioxide emissions. sustainability some major organizations are hailing farming within agroecosystems as the way forward for mainstream agriculture. current farming methods have resulted in over-stretched water resources, high levels of erosion and reduced soil fertility. according to a report by the international water management institute and unep, there is not enough water to continue farming using current practices; therefore how critical water, land, and ecosystem resources are used to boost crop yields must be reconsidered. the report suggested assigning value to ecosystems, recognizing environmental and livelihood tradeoffs, and balancing the rights of a variety of users and interests. inequities that result when such measures are adopted would need to be addressed, such as the reallocation of water from poor to rich, the clearing of land to make way for more productive farmland, or the preservation of a wetland system that limits fishing rights.
technological advancements help provide farmers with tools and resources to make farming more sustainable. new technologies have given rise to innovations like conservation tillage, a farming process which helps prevent land loss to erosion, water pollution and enhances carbon sequestration.
according to a report by the international food policy research institute (ifpri), agricultural technologies will have the greatest impact on food production if adopted in combination with each other; using a model that assessed how eleven technologies could impact agricultural productivity, food security and trade by 2050, ifpri found that the number of people at risk from hunger could be reduced by as much as 40% and food prices could be reduced by almost half. agricultural economics agricultural economics refers to economics as it relates to the production, distribution and consumption of [agricultural] goods and services. combining agricultural production with general theories of marketing and business as a discipline of study began in the late 1800s, and grew significantly through the 20th century. although the study of agricultural economics is relatively recent, major trends in agriculture have significantly affected national and international economies throughout history, ranging from tenant farmers and sharecropping in the post-american civil war southern united states to the european feudal system of manorialism. in the united states, and elsewhere, food costs attributed to food processing, distribution, and agricultural marketing, sometimes referred to as the value chain, have risen while the costs attributed to farming have declined. this is related to the greater efficiency of farming, combined with the increased level of value addition (e.g. more highly processed products) provided by the supply chain. market concentration has increased in the sector as well, and although the total effect of the increased market concentration is likely increased efficiency, the changes redistribute economic surplus from producers (farmers) and consumers, and may have negative implications for rural communities.
national government policies can significantly change the economic marketplace for agricultural products, in the form of taxation, subsidies, tariffs and other measures. since at least the 1960s, a combination of import/export restrictions, exchange rate policies and subsidies have affected farmers in both the developing and developed world. in the 1980s, it was clear that non-subsidized farmers in developing countries were experiencing adverse effects from national policies that created artificially low global prices for farm products. between the mid-1980s and the early 2000s, several international agreements were put into place that limited agricultural tariffs, subsidies and other trade restrictions.
however, as of 2009, there was still a significant amount of policy-driven distortion in global agricultural product prices. the three agricultural products with the greatest amount of trade distortion were sugar, milk and rice, mainly due to taxation. among the oilseeds, sesame had the greatest amount of taxation, but overall, feed grains and oilseeds had much lower levels of taxation than livestock products. since the 1980s, policy-driven distortions have seen a greater decrease among livestock products than crops during the worldwide reforms in agricultural policy. despite this progress, certain crops, such as cotton, still see subsidies in developed countries artificially deflating global prices, causing hardship in developing countries with non-subsidized farmers. unprocessed commodities (i.e. corn, soybeans, cows) are generally graded to indicate quality. the quality affects the price the producer receives. commodities are generally reported by production quantities, such as volume, number or weight. agricultural science agricultural science is a broad multidisciplinary field of biology that encompasses the parts of exact, natural, economic and social sciences that are used in the practice and understanding of agriculture. (veterinary science, but not animal science, is often excluded from the definition.) list of countries by agricultural output energy and agriculture since the 1940s, agricultural productivity has increased dramatically, due largely to the increased use of energy-intensive mechanization, fertilizers and pesticides. the vast majority of this energy input comes from fossil fuel sources. between the 1960–65 measuring cycle and the cycle from 1986 to 1990, the green revolution transformed agriculture around the globe, with world grain production increasing significantly (between 70% and 390% for wheat and 60% to 150% for rice, depending on geographic area) as world population doubled. modern agriculture's heavy reliance on petrochemicals and mechanization has raised concerns that oil shortages could increase costs and reduce agricultural output, causing food shortages.
modern or industrialized agriculture is dependent on fossil fuels in two fundamental ways: 1. direct consumption on the farm and 2. indirect consumption to manufacture inputs used on the farm. direct consumption includes the use of lubricants and fuels to operate farm vehicles and machinery; and use of gasoline, liquid propane, and electricity to power dryers, pumps, lights, heaters, and coolers. american farms directly consumed about 1.2 exajoules (1.1 quadrillion btu) in 2002, or just over 1% of the nation's total energy.
indirect consumption is mainly oil and natural gas used to manufacture fertilizers and pesticides, which accounted for 0.6 exajoules (0.6 quadrillion btu) in 2002. the natural gas and coal consumed by the production of nitrogen fertilizer can account for over half of the agricultural energy usage. china utilizes mostly coal in the production of nitrogen fertilizer, while most of europe uses large amounts of natural gas and small amounts of coal. according to a 2010 report published by the royal society, agriculture is increasingly dependent on the direct and indirect input of fossil fuels. overall, the fuels used in agriculture vary based on several factors, including crop, production system and location. the energy used to manufacture farm machinery is also a form of indirect agricultural energy consumption. together, direct and indirect consumption by us farms accounts for about 2% of the nation's energy use. direct and indirect energy consumption by u.s. farms peaked in 1979, and has gradually declined over the past 30 years. food systems encompass not just agricultural production, but also off-farm processing, packaging, transporting, marketing, consumption, and disposal of food and food-related items. agriculture accounts for less than one-fifth of food system energy use in the us. mitigation of effects of petroleum shortages in the event of a petroleum shortage (see peak oil for global concerns), organic agriculture can be more attractive than conventional practices that use petroleum-based pesticides, herbicides, or fertilizers. some studies using modern organic-farming methods have reported yields equal to or higher than those available from conventional farming. in the aftermath of the fall of the soviet union, with shortages of conventional petroleum-based inputs, cuba made use of mostly organic practices, including biopesticides, plant-based pesticides and sustainable cropping practices, to feed its populace. however, organic farming may be more labor-intensive and would require a shift of the workforce from urban to rural areas. the reconditioning of soil to restore organic matter lost during the use of monoculture agriculture techniques is important to provide a reservoir of plant-available nutrients, to maintain texture, and to minimize erosion.
it has been suggested that rural communities might obtain fuel from the biochar and synfuel process, which uses agricultural waste to provide charcoal fertilizer, some fuel and food, instead of the normal food vs. fuel debate. as the synfuel would be used on-site, the process would be more efficient and might just provide enough fuel for a new organic-agriculture fusion.
it has been suggested that some transgenic plants may some day be developed which would allow for maintaining or increasing yields while requiring fewer fossil-fuel-derived inputs than conventional crops. the possibility of success of these programs is questioned by ecologists and economists concerned with unsustainable gmo practices such as terminator seeds. while there has been some research on sustainability using gmo crops, at least one prominent multi-year attempt by monsanto company has been unsuccessful, though during the same period traditional breeding techniques yielded a more sustainable variety of the same crop. policy agricultural policy is the set of government decisions and actions relating to domestic agriculture and imports of foreign agricultural products. governments usually implement agricultural policies with the goal of achieving a specific outcome in the domestic agricultural product markets. some overarching themes include risk management and adjustment (including policies related to climate change, food safety and natural disasters), economic stability (including policies related to taxes), natural resources and environmental sustainability (especially water policy), research and development, and market access for domestic commodities (including relations with global organizations and agreements with other countries). agricultural policy can also touch on food quality, ensuring that the food supply is of a consistent and known quality, food security, ensuring that the food supply meets the population's needs, and conservation. policy programs can range from financial programs, such as subsidies, to encouraging producers to enroll in voluntary quality assurance programs.
there are many influences on the creation of agricultural policy, including consumers, agribusiness, trade lobbies and other groups. agribusiness interests hold a large amount of influence over policy making, in the form of lobbying and campaign contributions. political action groups, including those interested in environmental issues and labor unions, also provide influence, as do lobbying organizations representing individual agricultural commodities. the food and agriculture organization of the united nations (fao) leads international efforts to defeat hunger and provides a forum for the negotiation of global agricultural regulations and agreements. dr. samuel jutzi, director of fao's animal production and health division, states that lobbying by large corporations has stopped reforms that would improve human health and the environment. for example, proposals in 2010 for a voluntary code of conduct for the livestock industry that would have provided incentives for improving standards for health, and environmental regulations, such as the number of animals an area of land can support without long-term damage, were successfully defeated due to large food company pressure. see also references further reading alvarez, robert a (2007). the march of empire: mangos, avocados, and the politics of transfer. gastronomica. 7 (3): 28–33. doi:10.1525/gfc.2007.7.3.28. bolens, l.

history (from greek ἱστορία, historia, meaning inquiry, knowledge acquired by investigation) is the study of the past as it is described in written documents. events occurring before written record are considered prehistory. it is an umbrella term that relates to past events as well as the memory, discovery, collection, organization, presentation, and interpretation of information about these events. scholars who write about history are called historians.
history can also refer to the academic discipline which uses a narrative to examine and analyse a sequence of past events, and objectively determine the patterns of cause and effect that determine them. historians sometimes debate the nature of history and its usefulness by discussing the study of the discipline as an end in itself and as a way of providing perspective on the problems of the present.
stories common to a particular culture, but not supported by external sources (such as the tales surrounding king arthur), are usually classified as cultural heritage or legends, because they do not show the disinterested investigation required of the discipline of history. herodotus, a 5th-century bc greek historian is considered within the western tradition to be the father of history, and, along with his contemporary thucydides, helped form the foundations for the modern study of human history. their works continue to be read today, and the gap between the culture-focused herodotus and the military-focused thucydides remains a point of contention or approach in modern historical writing. in asia, a state chronicle, the spring and autumn annals was known to be compiled from as early as 722 bc although only 2nd-century bc texts survived.
ancient influences have helped spawn variant interpretations of the nature of history which have evolved over the centuries and continue to change today. the modern study of history is wide-ranging, and includes the study of specific regions and the study of certain topical or thematical elements of historical investigation. often history is taught as part of primary and secondary education, and the academic study of history is a major discipline in university studies. etymology the word history comes ultimately from ancient greek ἱστορία (historía), meaning inquiry, knowledge from inquiry, or judge. it was in that sense that aristotle used the word in his Περὶ Τὰ Ζῷα Ἱστορίαι (perì tà zôa Ηistoríai inquiries about animals). the ancestor word ἵστωρ is attested early on in homeric hymns, heraclitus, the athenian ephebes' oath, and in boiotic inscriptions (in a legal sense, either judge or witness, or similar).
the greek word was borrowed into classical latin as historia, meaning investigation, inquiry, research, account, description, written account of past events, writing of history, historical narrative, recorded knowledge of past events, story, narrative. history was borrowed from latin (possibly via old irish or old welsh) into old english as stær ('history, narrative, story'), but this word fell out of use in the late old english period.
meanwhile, as latin became old french (and anglo-norman), historia developed into forms such as istorie, estoire, and historie, with new developments in the meaning: account of the events of a person's life (beginning of the 12th century), chronicle, account of events as relevant to a group of people or people in general (1155), dramatic or pictorial representation of historical events (c. 1240), body of knowledge relative to human evolution, science (c. 1265), narrative of real or imaginary events, story (c. 1462).
it was from anglo-norman that history was borrowed into middle english, and this time the loan stuck. it appears in the thirteenth-century ancrene wisse, but seems to have become a common word in the late fourteenth century, with an early attestation appearing in john gower's confessio amantis of the 1390s (vi.1383): i finde in a bok compiled | to this matiere an old histoire, | the which comth nou to mi memoire. in middle english, the meaning of history was story in general. the restriction to the meaning the branch of knowledge that deals with past events; the formal record or study of past events, esp. human affairs arose in the mid-fifteenth century.
with the renaissance, older senses of the word were revived, and it was in the greek sense that francis bacon used the term in the late sixteenth century, when he wrote about natural history. for him, historia was the knowledge of objects determined by space and time, that sort of knowledge provided by memory (while science was provided by reason, and poetry was provided by fantasy).
in an expression of the linguistic synthetic vs. analytic/isolating dichotomy, english like chinese (史 vs. 诌) now designates separate words for human history and storytelling in general. in modern german, french, and most germanic and romance languages, which are solidly synthetic and highly inflected, the same word is still used to mean both history and story.
the adjective historical is attested from 1661, and historic from 1669.
historian in the sense of a researcher of history is attested from 1531. in all european languages, the substantive history is still used to mean both what happened with men, and the scholarly study of the happened, the latter sense sometimes distinguished with a capital letter, history, or the word historiography. description historians write in the context of their own time, and with due regard to the current dominant ideas of how to interpret the past, and sometimes write to provide lessons for their own society. in the words of benedetto croce, all history is contemporary history. history is facilitated by the formation of a 'true discourse of past' through the production of narrative and analysis of past events relating to the human race. the modern discipline of history is dedicated to the institutional production of this discourse.
all events that are remembered and preserved in some authentic form constitute the historical record. the task of historical discourse is to identify the sources which can most usefully contribute to the production of accurate accounts of past. therefore, the constitution of the historian's archive is a result of circumscribing a more general archive by invalidating the usage of certain texts and documents (by falsifying their claims to represent the 'true past').
the study of history has sometimes been classified as part of the humanities and at other times as part of the social sciences. it can also be seen as a bridge between those two broad areas, incorporating methodologies from both. some individual historians strongly support one or the other classification. in the 20th century, french historian fernand braudel revolutionized the study of history, by using such outside disciplines as economics, anthropology, and geography in the study of global history.
traditionally, historians have recorded events of the past, either in writing or by passing on an oral tradition, and have attempted to answer historical questions through the study of written documents and oral accounts. from the beginning, historians have also used such sources as monuments, inscriptions, and pictures. in general, the sources of historical knowledge can be separated into three categories: what is written, what is said, and what is physically preserved, and historians often consult all three. but writing is the marker that separates history from what comes before.
archaeology is a discipline that is especially helpful in dealing with buried sites and objects, which, once unearthed, contribute to the study of history. but archaeology rarely stands alone. it uses narrative sources to complement its discoveries. however, archaeology is constituted by a range of methodologies and approaches which are independent from history; that is to say, archaeology does not fill the gaps within textual sources. indeed, historical archaeology is a specific branch of archaeology, often contrasting its conclusions against those of contemporary textual sources. for example, mark leone, the excavator and interpreter of historical annapolis, maryland, usa; has sought to understand the contradiction between textual documents and the material record, demonstrating the possession of slaves and the inequalities of wealth apparent via the study of the total historical environment, despite the ideology of liberty inherent in written documents at this time.
there are varieties of ways in which history can be organized, including chronologically, culturally, territorially, and thematically. these divisions are not mutually exclusive, and significant overlaps are often present, as in the international women's movement in an age of transition, 1830–1975. it is possible for historians to concern themselves with both the very specific and the very general, although the modern trend has been toward specialization. the area called big history resists this specialization, and searches for universal patterns or trends. history has often been studied with some practical or theoretical aim, but also may be studied out of simple intellectual curiosity. history and prehistory the history of the world is the memory of the past experience of homo sapiens sapiens around the world, as that experience has been preserved, largely in written records. by prehistory, historians mean the recovery of knowledge of the past in an area where no written records exist, or where the writing of a culture is not understood. by studying painting, drawings, carvings, and other artifacts, some information can be recovered even in the absence of a written record. since the 20th century, the study of prehistory is considered essential to avoid history's implicit exclusion of certain civilizations, such as those of sub-saharan africa and pre-columbian america. historians in the west have been criticized for focusing disproportionately on the western world. in 1961, british historian e. h. carr wrote: the line of demarcation between prehistoric and historical times is crossed when people cease to live only in the present, and become consciously interested both in their past and in their future. history begins with the handing down of tradition; and tradition means the carrying of the habits and lessons of the past into the future. records of the past begin to be kept for the benefit of future generations. this definition includes within the scope of history the strong interests of peoples, such as indigenous australians and new zealand māori in the past, and the oral records maintained and transmitted to succeeding generations, even before their contact with european civilization. historiography historiography has a number of related meanings. firstly, it can refer to how history has been produced: the story of the development of methodology and practices (for example, the move from short-term biographical narrative towards long-term thematic analysis). secondly, it can refer to what has been produced: a specific body of historical writing (for example, medieval historiography during the 1960s means works of medieval history written during the 1960s). thirdly, it may refer to why history is produced: the philosophy of history. as a meta-level analysis of descriptions of the past, this third conception can relate to the first two in that the analysis usually focuses on the narratives, interpretations, world view, use of evidence, or method of presentation of other historians. professional historians also debate the question of whether history can be taught as a single coherent narrative or a series of competing narratives. philosophy of history philosophy of history is a branch of philosophy concerning the eventual significance, if any, of human history. furthermore, it speculates as to a possible teleological end to its development—that is, it asks if there is a design, purpose, directive principle, or finality in the processes of human history. philosophy of history should not be confused with historiography, which is the study of history as an academic discipline, and thus concerns its methods and practices, and its development as a discipline over time. nor should philosophy of history be confused with the history of philosophy, which is the study of the development of philosophical ideas through time. historical methods the historical method comprises the techniques and guidelines by which historians use primary sources and other evidence to research and then to write history.
herodotus of halicarnassus (484 bc – ca.425 bc) has generally been acclaimed as the father of history. however, his contemporary thucydides (c. 460 bc – ca. 400 bc) is credited with having first approached history with a well-developed historical method in his work the history of the peloponnesian war. thucydides, unlike herodotus, regarded history as being the product of the choices and actions of human beings, and looked at cause and effect, rather than as the result of divine intervention. in his historical method, thucydides emphasized chronology, a neutral point of view, and that the human world was the result of the actions of human beings. greek historians also viewed history as cyclical, with events regularly recurring.
there were historical traditions and sophisticated use of historical method in ancient and medieval china. the groundwork for professional historiography in east asia was established by the han dynasty court historian known as sima qian (145–90 bc), author of the records of the grand historian (shiji). for the quality of his written work, sima qian is posthumously known as the father of chinese historiography. chinese historians of subsequent dynastic periods in china used his shiji as the official format for historical texts, as well as for biographical literature.
saint augustine was influential in christian and western thought at the beginning of the medieval period. through the medieval and renaissance periods, history was often studied through a sacred or religious perspective. around 1800, german philosopher and historian georg wilhelm friedrich hegel brought philosophy and a more secular approach in historical study.
in the preface to his book, the muqaddimah (1377), the arab historian and early sociologist, ibn khaldun, warned of seven mistakes that he thought that historians regularly committed. in this criticism, he approached the past as strange and in need of interpretation. the originality of ibn khaldun was to claim that the cultural difference of another age must govern the evaluation of relevant historical material, to distinguish the principles according to which it might be possible to attempt the evaluation, and lastly, to feel the need for experience, in addition to rational principles, in order to assess a culture of the past. ibn khaldun often criticized idle superstition and uncritical acceptance of historical data. as a result, he introduced a scientific method to the study of history, and he often referred to it as his new science. his historical method also laid the groundwork for the observation of the role of state, communication, propaganda and systematic bias in history, and he is thus considered to be the father of historiography or the father of the philosophy of history.
in the west, historians developed modern methods of historiography in the 17th and 18th centuries, especially in france and germany. the 19th-century historian with greatest influence on methods was leopold von ranke in germany.
in the 20th century, academic historians focused less on epic nationalistic narratives, which often tended to glorify the nation or great men, to more objective and complex analyses of social and intellectual forces. a major trend of historical methodology in the 20th century was a tendency to treat history more as a social science rather than as an art, which traditionally had been the case. some of the leading advocates of history as a social science were a diverse collection of scholars which included fernand braudel, e. h. carr, fritz fischer, emmanuel le roy ladurie, hans-ulrich wehler, bruce trigger, marc bloch, karl dietrich bracher, peter gay, robert fogel, lucien febvre and lawrence stone. many of the advocates of history as a social science were or are noted for their multi-disciplinary approach. braudel combined history with geography, bracher history with political science, fogel history with economics, gay history with psychology, trigger history with archaeology while wehler, bloch, fischer, stone, febvre and le roy ladurie have in varying and differing ways amalgamated history with sociology, geography, anthropology, and economics. more recently, the field of digital history has begun to address ways of using computer technology to pose new questions to historical data and generate digital scholarship.
in opposition to the claims of history as a social science, historians such as hugh trevor-roper, john lukacs, donald creighton, gertrude himmelfarb and gerhard ritter argued that the key to the historians' work was the power of the imagination, and hence contended that history should be understood as an art. french historians associated with the annales school introduced quantitative history, using raw data to track the lives of typical individuals, and were prominent in the establishment of cultural history (cf. histoire des mentalités). intellectual historians such as herbert butterfield, ernst nolte and george mosse have argued for the significance of ideas in history. american historians, motivated by the civil rights era, focused on formerly overlooked ethnic, racial, and socio-economic groups. another genre of social history to emerge in the post-wwii era was alltagsgeschichte (history of everyday life). scholars such as martin broszat, ian kershaw and detlev peukert sought to examine what everyday life was like for ordinary people in 20th-century germany, especially in the nazi period.
marxist historians such as eric hobsbawm, e. p. thompson, rodney hilton, georges lefebvre, eugene genovese, isaac deutscher, c. l. r. james, timothy mason, herbert aptheker, arno j. mayer and christopher hill have sought to validate karl marx's theories by analyzing history from a marxist perspective. in response to the marxist interpretation of history, historians such as françois furet, richard pipes, j. c. d. clark, roland mousnier, henry ashby turner and robert conquest have offered anti-marxist interpretations of history. feminist historians such as joan wallach scott, claudia koonz, natalie zemon davis, sheila rowbotham, gisela bock, gerda lerner, elizabeth fox-genovese, and lynn hunt have argued for the importance of studying the experience of women in the past. in recent years, postmodernists have challenged the validity and need for the study of history on the basis that all history is based on the personal interpretation of sources. in his 1997 book in defence of history, richard j. evans, a professor of modern history at cambridge university, defended the worth of history. another defence of history from post-modernist criticism was the australian historian keith windschuttle's 1994 book, the killing of history. marxian theory of history the marxist theory of historical materialism theorises that society is fundamentally determined by the material conditions at any given time – in other words, the relationships which people have with each other in order to fulfill basic needs such as feeding, clothing and housing themselves and their families. overall, marx and engels claimed to have identified five successive stages of the development of these material conditions in western europe. marxist historiography was once orthodoxy in the soviet union, but since the collapse of communism there in 1991, mikhail krom says it has been reduced to the margins of scholarship. areas of study periods historical study often focuses on events and developments that occur in particular blocks of time. historians give these periods of time names in order to allow organising ideas and classificatory generalisations to be used by historians. the names given to a period can vary with geographical location, as can the dates of the beginning and end of a particular period. centuries and decades are commonly used periods and the time they represent depends on the dating system used. most periods are constructed retrospectively and so reflect value judgments made about the past. the way periods are constructed and the names given to them can affect the way they are viewed and studied. prehistoric periodisation the field of history generally leaves prehistory to the archaeologists, who have entirely different sets of tools and theories. the usual method for periodisation of the distant prehistoric past, in archaeology is to rely on changes in material culture and technology, such as the stone age, bronze age and iron age and their sub-divisions also based on different styles of material remains. despite the development over recent decades of the ability through radiocarbon dating and other scientific methods to give actual dates for many sites or artefacts, these long-established schemes seem likely to remain in use. in many cases neighbouring cultures with writing have left some history of cultures without it, which may be used. geographical locations particular geographical locations can form the basis of historical study, for example, continents, countries and cities. understanding why historic events took place is important. to do this, historians often turn to geography. weather patterns, the water supply, and the landscape of a place all affect the lives of the people who live there. for example, to explain why the ancient egyptians developed a successful civilization, studying the geography of egypt is essential. egyptian civilization was built on the banks of the nile river, which flooded each year, depositing soil on its banks. the rich soil could help farmers grow enough crops to feed the people in the cities. that meant everyone did not have to farm, so some people could perform other jobs that helped develop the civilization. regions history of africa begins with the first emergence of modern human beings on the continent, continuing into its modern present as a patchwork of diverse and politically developing nation states.

history of southeast asia has been characterized as interaction between regional players and foreign powers. military history military history concerns warfare, strategies, battles, weapons, and the psychology of combat. the new military history since the 1970s has been concerned with soldiers more than generals, with psychology more than tactics, and with the broader impact of warfare on society and culture. history of religion the history of religion has been a main theme for both secular and religious historians for centuries, and continues to be taught in seminaries and academe. leading journals include church history, the catholic historical review, and history of religions. topics range widely from political and cultural and artistic dimensions, to theology and liturgy. this subject studies religions from all regions and areas of the world where humans have lived. social history social history, sometimes called the new social history, is the field that includes history of ordinary people and their strategies and institutions for coping with life. in its golden age it was a major growth field in the 1960s and 1970s among scholars, and still is well represented in history departments. in two decades from 1975 to 1995, the proportion of professors of history in american universities identifying with social history rose from 31% to 41%, while the proportion of political historians fell from 40% to 30%. in the history departments of british universities in 2007, of the 5723 faculty members, 1644 (29%) identified themselves with social history while political history came next with 1425 (25%). the old social history before the 1960s was a hodgepodge of topics without a central theme, and it often included political movements, like populism, that were social in the sense of being outside the elite system. social history was contrasted with political history, intellectual history and the history of great men. english historian g. m. trevelyan saw it as the bridging point between economic and political history, reflecting that, without social history, economic history is barren and political history unintelligible. while the field has often been viewed negatively as history with the politics left out, it has also been defended as history with the people put back in. subfields the chief subfields of social history include:
demographic history
history of education
ethnic history
history of the family
labour history
rural history

gender history cultural history cultural history replaced social history as the dominant form in the 1980s and 1990s. it typically combines the approaches of anthropology and history to look at language, popular cultural traditions and cultural interpretations of historical experience. it examines the records and narrative descriptions of past knowledge, customs, and arts of a group of people. how peoples constructed their memory of the past is a major topic. cultural history includes the study of art in society as well is the study of images and human visual production (iconography). diplomatic history diplomatic history focuses on the relationships between nations, primarily regarding diplomacy and the causes of wars. more recently it looks at the causes of peace and human rights. it typically presents the viewpoints of the foreign office, and long-term strategic values, as the driving force of continuity and change in history. this type of political history is the study of the conduct of international relations between states or across state boundaries over time. historian muriel chamberlain notes that after the first world war, diplomatic history replaced constitutional history as the flagship of historical investigation, at once the most important, most exact and most sophisticated of historical studies. she adds that after 1945, the trend reversed, allowing social history to replace it. economic history although economic history has been well established since the late 19th century, in recent years academic studies have shifted more and more toward economics departments and away from traditional history departments. business history deals with the history of individual business organizations, business methods, government regulation, labour relations, and impact on society. it also includes biographies of individual companies, executives, and entrepreneurs. it is related to economic history; business history is most often taught in business schools. environmental history environmental history is a new field that emerged in the 1980s to look at the history of the environment, especially in the long run, and the impact of human activities upon it. world history world history is the study of major civilizations over the last 3000 years or so. world history is primarily a teaching field, rather than a research field. it gained popularity in the united states, japan and other countries after the 1980s with the realization that students need a broader exposure to the world as globalization proceeds.
it has led to highly controversial interpretations by oswald spengler and arnold j. toynbee, among others.
the world history association publishes the journal of world history every quarter since 1990. the h-world discussion list serves as a network of communication among practitioners of world history, with discussions among scholars, announcements, syllabi, bibliographies and book reviews. people's history a people's history is a type of historical work which attempts to account for historical events from the perspective of common people. a people's history is the history of the world that is the story of mass movements and of the outsiders. individuals or groups not included in the past in other type of writing about history are the primary focus, which includes the disenfranchised, the oppressed, the poor, the nonconformists, and the otherwise forgotten people. the authors are typically on the left and have a socialist model in mind, as in the approach of the history workshop movement in britain in the 1960s. intellectual history intellectual history and the history of ideas emerged in the mid-20th century, with the focus on the intellectuals and their books on the one hand, and on the other the study of ideas as disembodied objects with a career of their own. gender history gender history is a sub-field of history and gender studies, which looks at the past from the perspective of gender. it is in many ways, an outgrowth of women's history. despite its relatively short life, gender history (and its forerunner women's history) has had a rather significant effect on the general study of history. since the 1960s, when the initially small field first achieved a measure of acceptance, it has gone through a number of different phases, each with its own challenges and outcomes. although some of the changes to the study of history have been quite obvious, such as increased numbers of books on famous women or simply the admission of greater numbers of women into the historical profession, other influences are more subtle. public history public history describes the broad range of activities undertaken by people with some training in the discipline of history who are generally working outside of specialized academic settings. public history practice has quite deep roots in the areas of historic preservation, archival science, oral history, museum curatorship, and other related fields. the term itself began to be used in the u.s. and canada in the late 1970s, and the field has become increasingly professionalized since that time. some of the most common settings for public history are museums, historic homes and historic sites, parks, battlefields, archives, film and television companies, and all levels of government. historians professional and amateur historians discover, collect, organize, and present information about past events. in lists of historians, historians can be grouped by order of the historical period in which they were writing, which is not necessarily the same as the period in which they specialized. chroniclers and annalists, though they are not historians in the true sense, are also frequently included. the judgement of history since the 20th century, western historians have disavowed the aspiration to provide the judgement of history. the goals of historical judgements or interpretations are separate to those of legal judgements, that need to be formulated quickly after the events and be final. a related issue to that of the judgement of history is that of collective memory. pseudohistory pseudohistory is a term applied to texts which purport to be historical in nature but which depart from standard historiographical conventions in a way which undermines their conclusions. closely related to deceptive historical revisionism, works which draw controversial conclusions from new, speculative, or disputed historical evidence, particularly in the fields of national, political, military, and religious affairs, are often rejected as pseudohistory. teaching history scholarship vs teaching a major intellectual battle took place in britain in the early twentieth century regarding the place of history teaching in the universities. at oxford and cambridge, scholarship was downplayed. professor charles harding firth, oxford's regius professor of history in 1904 ridiculed the system as best suited to produce superficial journalists. the oxford tutors, who had more votes than the professors, fought back in defence of their system saying that it successfully produced britain's outstanding statesmen, administrators, prelates, and diplomats, and that mission was as valuable as training scholars. the tutors dominated the debate until after the second world war. it forced aspiring young scholars to teach at outlying schools, such as manchester university, where thomas frederick tout was professionalizing the history undergraduate programme at by introducing the study of original sources and requiring the writing of a thesis.
in the united states, scholarship was concentrated at the major phd-producing universities, while the large number of other colleges and universities focused on undergraduate teaching. a tendency in the 21st century was for the latter schools to increasingly demand scholarly productivity of their younger tenure-track faculty. furthermore, universities have increasingly relied on inexpensive part-time adjuncts to do most of the classroom teaching. nationalism from the origins of national school systems in the 19th century, the teaching of history to promote national sentiment has been a high priority. in the united states after world war i, a strong movement emerged at the university level to teach courses in western civilization, so as to give students a common heritage with europe. in the u.s. after 1980, attention increasingly moved toward teaching world history or requiring students to take courses in non-western cultures, to prepare students for life in a globalized economy.
at the university level, historians debate the question of whether history belongs more to social science or to the humanities. many view the field from both perspectives.
the teaching of history in french schools was influenced by the nouvelle histoire as disseminated after the 1960s by cahiers pédagogiques and enseignement and other journals for teachers. also influential was the institut national de recherche et de documentation pédagogique, (inrdp). joseph leif, the inspector-general of teacher training, said pupils children should learn about historians' approaches as well as facts and dates. louis françois, dean of the history/geography group in the inspectorate of national education advised that teachers should provide historic documents and promote active methods which would give pupils the immense happiness of discovery. proponents said it was a reaction against the memorization of names and dates that characterized teaching and left the students bored. traditionalists protested loudly it was a postmodern innovation that threatened to leave the youth ignorant of french patriotism and national identity. bias in school teaching in most countries history textbook are tools to foster nationalism and patriotism, and give students the official line about national enemies.
in many countries, history textbooks are sponsored by the national government and are written to put the national heritage in the most favourable light. for example, in japan, mention of the nanking massacre has been removed from textbooks and the entire second world war is given cursory treatment. other countries have complained. it was standard policy in communist countries to present only a rigid marxist historiography.
academic historians have often fought against the politicization of the textbooks, sometimes with success.
in 21st-century germany, the history curriculum is controlled by the 16 states, and is characterized not by superpatriotism but rather by an almost pacifistic and deliberately unpatriotic undertone and reflects principles formulated by international organizations such as unesco or the council of europe, thus oriented towards human rights, democracy and peace. the result is that german textbooks usually downplay national pride and ambitions and aim to develop an understanding of citizenship centred on democracy, progress, human rights, peace, tolerance and europeanness. see also methods auxiliary sciences of history

literature, in its broadest sense, is any single body of written works. more restrictively, literature is writing that is considered to be an art form, or any single writing deemed to have artistic or intellectual value, often due to deploying language in ways that differ from ordinary usage.
its latin root literatura/litteratura (derived itself from littera: letter or handwriting) was used to refer to all written accounts, though contemporary definitions extend the term to include texts that are spoken or sung (oral literature). the concept has changed meaning over time: nowadays it can broaden to have non-written verbal art forms, and thus it is difficult to agree on its origin, which can be paired with that of language or writing itself. developments in print technology have allowed an evergrowing distribution and proliferation of written works, culminating in electronic literature.
literature can be classified according to whether it is fiction or non-fiction, and whether it is poetry or prose. it can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the novel, short story or drama; and works are often categorized according to historical periods or their adherence to certain aesthetic features or expectations (genre). definitions there have been various attempts to define literature. simon and delyse ryan begin their attempt to answer the question what is literature? with the observation: the quest to discover a definition for literature is a road that is much travelled, though the point of arrival, if ever reached, is seldom satisfactory. most attempted definitions are broad and vague, and they inevitably change over time. in fact, the only thing that is certain about defining literature is that the definition will change. concepts of what is literature change over time as well. definitions of literature have varied over time: it is a culturally relative definition. in western europe prior to the 18th century, literature denoted all books and writing. a more restricted sense of the term emerged during the romantic period, in which it began to demarcate imaginative writing. contemporary debates over what constitutes literature can be seen as returning to older, more inclusive notions; cultural studies, for instance, takes as its subject of analysis both popular and minority genres, in addition to canonical works.
the value judgment definition of literature considers it to cover exclusively those writings that possess high quality or distinction, forming part of the so-called belles-lettres ('fine writing') tradition. this sort of definition is that used in the encyclopædia britannica eleventh edition (1910–11) when it classifies literature as the best expression of the best thought reduced to writing. problematic in this view is that there is no objective definition of what constitutes literature: anything can be literature, and anything which is universally regarded as literature has the potential to be excluded, since value judgments can change over time.
the formalist definition is that literature foregrounds poetic effects; it is the literariness or poetic of literature that distinguishes it from ordinary speech or other kinds of writing (e.g., journalism). jim meyer considers this a useful characteristic in explaining the use of the term to mean published material in a particular field (e.g., scientific literature), as such writing must use language according to particular standards. the problem with the formalist definition is that in order to say that literature deviates from ordinary uses of language, those uses must first be identified; this is difficult because ordinary language is an unstable category, differing according to social categories and across history.
etymologically, the term derives from latin literatura/litteratura learning, a writing, grammar, originally writing formed with letters, from litera/littera letter. in spite of this, the term has also been applied to spoken or sung texts. major forms poetry poetry is a form of literary art which uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of language to evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, prosaic ostensible meaning. poetry has traditionally been distinguished from prose by its being set in verse; prose is cast in sentences, poetry in lines; the syntax of prose is dictated by meaning, whereas that of poetry is held across meter or the visual aspects of the poem. prior to the 19th century, poetry was commonly understood to be something set in metrical lines; accordingly, in 1658 a definition of poetry is any kind of subject consisting of rythm or verses. possibly as a result of aristotle's influence (his poetics), poetry before the 19th century was usually less a technical designation for verse than a normative category of fictive or rhetorical art. as a form it may pre-date literacy, with the earliest works being composed within and sustained by an oral tradition; hence it constitutes the earliest example of literature. prose prose is a form of language that possesses ordinary syntax and natural speech rather than rhythmic structure; in which regard, along with its measurement in sentences rather than lines, it differs from poetry. on the historical development of prose, richard graff notes that [in the case of ancient greece] recent scholarship has emphasized the fact that formal prose was a comparatively late development, an invention properly associated with the classical period.
novel: a long fictional prose narrative. it was the form's close relation to real life that differentiated it from the chivalric romance; in most european languages the equivalent term is roman, indicating the proximity of the forms. in english, the term emerged from the romance languages in the late 15th century, with the meaning of news; it came to indicate something new, without a distinction between fact or fiction. although there are many historical prototypes, so-called novels before the novel, the modern novel form emerges late in cultural history—roughly during the eighteenth century. initially subject to much criticism, the novel has acquired a dominant position amongst literary forms, both popularly and critically.
novella: in purely quantitative terms, the novella exists between the novel and short story; the publisher melville house classifies it as too short to be a novel, too long to be a short story. there is no precise definition in terms of word or page count. literary prizes and publishing houses often have their own arbitrary limits, which vary according to their particular intentions. summarizing the variable definitions of the novella, william giraldi concludes [it is a form] whose identity seems destined to be disputed into perpetuity. it has been suggested that the size restriction of the form produces various stylistic results, both some that are shared with the novel or short story, and others unique to the form.
short story: a dilemma in defining the short story as a literary form is how to, or whether one should, distinguish it from any short narrative; hence it also has a contested origin, variably suggested as the earliest short narratives (e.g. the bible), early short story writers (e.g. edgar allan poe), or the clearly modern short story writers (e.g. anton chekhov). apart from its distinct size, various theorists have suggested that the short story has a characteristic subject matter or structure; these discussions often position the form in some relation to the novel. drama drama is literature intended for performance. the form is often combined with music and dance, as in opera and musical theater. a play is a subset of this form, referring to the written dramatic work of a playwright that is intended for performance in a theater; it comprises chiefly dialogue between characters, and usually aims at dramatic or theatrical performance rather than at reading. a closet drama, by contrast, refers to a play written to be read rather than to be performed; hence, it is intended that the meaning of such a work can be realized fully on the page. nearly all drama took verse form until comparatively recently.
greek drama exemplifies the earliest form of drama of which we have substantial knowledge. tragedy, as a dramatic genre, developed as a performance associated with religious and civic festivals, typically enacting or developing upon well-known historical or mythological themes. tragedies generally presented very serious themes. with the advent of newer technologies, scripts written for non-stage media have been added to this form. war of the worlds (radio) in 1938 saw the advent of literature written for radio broadcast, and many works of drama have been adapted for film or television. conversely, television, film, and radio literature have been adapted to printed or electronic media. history the history of literature follows closely the development of civilization. when defined exclusively as written work, ancient egyptian literature, along with sumerian literature are considered the world's oldest literatures. the primary genres of the literature of ancient egypt—didactic texts, hymns and prayers, and tales—were almost entirely written in verse; while use of poetic devices is clearly recognizable, the prosody of the verse is unknown.
different historical periods are reflected in literature. national and tribal sagas, accounts of the origin of the world and of customs, and myths which sometimes carry moral or spiritual messages predominate in the pre-urban eras. the epics of homer, dating from the early to middle iron age, and the great indian epics of a slightly later period, have more evidence of deliberate literary authorship, surviving like the older myths through oral tradition for long periods before being written down.
literature in all its forms can be seen as written records, whether the literature itself be factual or fictional, it is still quite possible to decipher facts through things like characters' actions and words or the authors' style of writing and the intent behind the words. the plot is for more than just entertainment purposes; within it lies information about economics, psychology, science, religions, politics, cultures, and social depth. studying and analyzing literature becomes very important in terms of learning about our history. through the study of past literature we are able to learn about how society has evolved and about the societal norms during each of the different periods all throughout history. this can even help us to understand references made in more modern literature because authors often make references to greek mythology and other old religious texts or historical moments. not only is there literature written on each of the aforementioned topics themselves, and how they have evolved throughout history (like a book about the history of economics or a book about evolution and science, for example) but one can also learn about these things in fictional works. authors often include historical moments in their works, like when lord byron talks about the spanish and the french in childe harold's pilgrimage: canto i and expresses his opinions through his character childe harold. through literature we are able to continuously uncover new information about history. it is easy to see how all academic fields have roots in literature. information became easier to pass down from generation to generation once we began to write it down. eventually everything was written down, from things like home remedies and cures for illness, or how to build shelter to traditions and religious practices. from there people were able to study literature, improve on ideas, further our knowledge, and academic fields such as the medical field or trades could be started. in much the same way as the literature that we study today continue to be updated as we continue to evolve and learn more and more.
as a more urban culture developed, academies provided a means of transmission for speculative and philosophical literature in early civilizations, resulting in the prevalence of literature in ancient china, ancient india, persia and ancient greece and rome. many works of earlier periods, even in narrative form, had a covert moral or didactic purpose, such as the sanskrit panchatantra or the metamorphoses of ovid. drama and satire also developed as urban culture provided a larger public audience, and later readership, for literary production. lyric poetry (as opposed to epic poetry) was often the speciality of courts and aristocratic circles, particularly in east asia where songs were collected by the chinese aristocracy as poems, the most notable being the shijing or book of songs. over a long period, the poetry of popular pre-literate balladry and song interpenetrated and eventually influenced poetry in the literary medium.
in ancient china, early literature was primarily focused on philosophy, historiography, military science, agriculture, and poetry. china, the origin of modern paper making and woodblock printing, produced the world's first print cultures. much of chinese literature originates with the hundred schools of thought period that occurred during the eastern zhou dynasty (769‒269 bce). the most important of these include the classics of confucianism, of daoism, of mohism, of legalism, as well as works of military science (e.g. sun tzu's the art of war) and chinese history (e.g. sima qian's records of the grand historian). ancient chinese literature had a heavy emphasis on historiography, with often very detailed court records. an exemplary piece of narrative history of ancient china was the zuo zhuan, which was compiled no later than 389 bce, and attributed to the blind 5th-century bce historian zuo qiuming.
in ancient india, literature originated from stories that were originally orally transmitted. early genres included drama, fables, sutras and epic poetry. sanskrit literature begins with the vedas, dating back to 1500–1000 bce, and continues with the sanskrit epics of iron age india. the vedas are among the oldest sacred texts. the samhitas (vedic collections) date to roughly 1500–1000 bce, and the circum-vedic texts, as well as the redaction of the samhitas, date to c. 1000‒500 bce, resulting in a vedic period, spanning the mid-2nd to mid 1st millennium bce, or the late bronze age and the iron age. the period between approximately the 6th to 1st centuries bc saw the composition and redaction of the two most influential indian epics, the mahabharata and the ramayana, with subsequent redaction progressing down to the 4th century ad. other major literary works are ramcharitmanas & krishnacharitmanas.
in ancient greece, the epics of homer, who wrote the iliad and the odyssey, and hesiod, who wrote works and days and theogony, are some of the earliest, and most influential, of ancient greek literature. classical greek genres included philosophy, poetry, historiography, comedies and dramas. plato and aristotle authored philosophical texts that are the foundation of western philosophy, sappho and pindar were influential lyric poets, and herodotus and thucydides were early greek historians. although drama was popular in ancient greece, of the hundreds of tragedies written and performed during the classical age, only a limited number of plays by three authors still exist: aeschylus, sophocles, and euripides. the plays of aristophanes provide the only real examples of a genre of comic drama known as old comedy, the earliest form of greek comedy, and are in fact used to define the genre. roman histories and biographies anticipated the extensive mediaeval literature of lives of saints and miraculous chronicles, but the most characteristic form of the middle ages was the romance, an adventurous and sometimes magical narrative with strong popular appeal. controversial, religious, political and instructional literature proliferated during the renaissance as a result of the invention of printing, while the mediaeval romance developed into a more character-based and psychological form of narrative, the novel, of which early and important examples are the chinese monkey and the german faust books.
in the age of reason philosophical tracts and speculations on history and human nature integrated literature with social and political developments. the inevitable reaction was the explosion of romanticism in the later 18th century which reclaimed the imaginative and fantastical bias of old romances and folk-literature and asserted the primacy of individual experience and emotion. but as the 19th century went on, european fiction evolved towards realism and naturalism, the meticulous documentation of real life and social trends. much of the output of naturalism was implicitly polemical, and influenced social and political change, but 20th century fiction and drama moved back towards the subjective, emphasizing unconscious motivations and social and environmental pressures on the individual. writers such as proust, eliot, joyce, kafka and pirandello exemplify the trend of documenting internal rather than external realities.
genre fiction also showed it could question reality in its 20th century forms, in spite of its fixed formulas, through the enquiries of the skeptical detective and the alternative realities of science fiction. the separation of mainstream and genre forms (including journalism) continued to blur during the period up to our own times. william burroughs, in his early works, and hunter s. thompson expanded documentary reporting into strong subjective statements after the second world war, and post-modern critics have disparaged the idea of objective realism in general. awards there are numerous awards recognizing achievement and contribution in literature. given the diversity of the field, awards are typically limited in scope, usually on: form, genre, language, nationality and output (e.g. for first-time writers or debut novels).
the nobel prize in literature was one of the six nobel prizes established by the will of alfred nobel in 1895, and is awarded to an author on the basis of their body of work, rather than to, or for, a particular work itself. other literary prizes for which all nationalities are eligible include: the neustadt international prize for literature, the man booker international prize and the franz kafka prize. essays an essay consists of a discussion of a topic from an author's personal point of view, exemplified by works by michel de montaigne or by charles lamb.
genres related to the essay may include the memoir and the epistle. other prose literature philosophical, historical, journalistic, and scientific writings are traditionally ranked as literature. they offer some of the oldest prose writings in existence; novels and prose stories earned the names fiction to distinguish them from factual writing or nonfiction, which writers historically have crafted in prose. natural science as advances and specialization have made new scientific research inaccessible to most audiences, the literary nature of science writing has become less pronounced over the last two centuries. now, science appears mostly in journals. scientific works of aristotle, copernicus, and newton still exhibit great value, but since the science in them has largely become outdated, they no longer serve for scientific instruction. yet, they remain too technical to sit well in most programs of literary study. outside of history of science programs, students rarely read such works. philosophy philosophy has become an increasingly academic discipline. more of its practitioners lament this situation than occurs with the sciences; nonetheless most new philosophical work appears in academic journals. major philosophers through history—plato, aristotle, socrates, augustine, descartes, kierkegaard, nietzsche—have become as canonical as any writers. some recent philosophy works are argued to merit the title literature, but much of it does not, and some areas, such as logic, have become extremely technical to a degree similar to that of mathematics. psychology literature allows readers to access intimate emotional aspects of a person's character that would not be obvious otherwise. it benefits the psychological development and understanding of the reader. for example, it allows a person to access emotional states from which the person has distanced himself or herself. an entry written by d. mitchell featured in the english journal explains how the author used young adult literature in order to re-experience the emotional psychology she experienced as a child which she describes as a state of wonder.
hogan also explains that the temporal and emotional amount which a person devotes to understanding a character's situation in literature allows literature to be considered ecological[ly] valid in the study of emotion. this can be understood in the sense that literature unites a large community by provoking universal emotions. it also allows readers to access cultural aspects that they are not exposed to thus provoking new emotional experiences. authors choose literary device according to what psychological emotion he or she is attempting to describe, thus certain literary devices are more emotionally effective than others.
furthermore, literature is being more popularly regarded as a psychologically effective research tool. it can be considered a research tool because it allows psychologists to discover new psychological aspects and it also allows psychologists to promote their theories. for example, the print capacity available for literature distribution has allowed psychological theories such as maslow's hierarchy of needs to be universally recognized.
maslow's third force psychology theory even allows literary analysts to critically understand how characters reflect the culture and the history in which they are contextualized. it also allows analysts to understand the author's intended message and to understand the author's psychology. the theory suggests that human beings possess a nature within them that demonstrates their true self and it suggests that the fulfillment of this nature is the reason for living. it also suggests that neurological development hinders actualizing the nature because a person becomes estranged from his or her true self. therefore, literary devices reflect a character's and an author's natural self. in his third force psychology and the study of literature, paris argues d.h. lawrence's 'pristine unconscious' is a metaphor for the real self. thus literature is a reputable tool that allows readers to develop and apply critical reasoning to the nature of emotions. history a significant portion of historical writing ranks as literature, particularly the genre known as creative nonfiction, as can a great deal of journalism, such as literary journalism. however, these areas have become extremely large, and often have a primarily utilitarian purpose: to record data or convey immediate information. as a result, the writing in these fields often lacks a literary quality, although it often(and in its better moments)has that quality. major literary historians include herodotus, thucydides and procopius, all of whom count as canonical literary figures. law law offers more ambiguity. some writings of plato and aristotle, the law tables of hammurabi of babylon, or even the early parts of the bible could be seen as legal literature. roman civil law as codified in the corpus juris civilis during the reign of justinian i of the byzantine empire has a reputation as significant literature. the founding documents of many countries, including constitutions and law codes, can count as literature. other narrative forms electronic literature is a literary genre consisting of works that originate in digital environments.
films, videos and broadcast soap operas have carved out a niche which often parallels the functionality of prose fiction.
graphic novels and comic books present stories told in a combination of sequential artwork, dialogue and text. genres of literature literary genre is a mode of categorizing literature. the term originates from french, designating a proposed type or class. however, such classes are subject to change, and have been used in different ways in different periods and traditions. literary techniques a literary technique or literary device can be used by authors in order to enhance the written framework of a piece of literature, and produce specific effects. literary techniques encompass a wide range of approaches to crafting a work: whether a work is narrated in first-person or from another perspective, whether to use a traditional linear narrative or a nonlinear narrative, or the choice of literary genre, are all examples of literary technique. they may indicate to a reader that there is a familiar structure and presentation to a work, such as a conventional murder-mystery novel; or, the author may choose to experiment with their technique to surprise the reader.
in this way, use of a technique can lead to the development of a new genre, as was the case with one of the first modern novels, pamela by samuel richardson. pamela is written as a collection of letter-writing correspondence, called epistolary technique; by using this technique, pamela strengthened the tradition of the epistolary novel, a genre which had been practiced for some time already but without the same acclaim.
literary technique is distinguished from literary device, as military strategy is distinguished from military tactics. devices are specific constructions within the narrative that make it effective. examples include metaphor, simile, ellipsis, narrative motifs, and allegory. even simple word play functions as a literary device. the narrative mode may be considered a literary device, such as the use of stream-of-consciousness narrative.
literary criticism implies a critique and evaluation of a piece of literature and, in some cases, it is used to improve a work in progress or a classical piece, as with an ongoing theater production. literary editors can serve a similar purpose for the authors with whom they work. there are many types of literary criticism and each can be used to critique a piece in a different way or critique a different aspect of a piece. legal status united kingdom literary works have been protected by copyright law from unauthorized reproduction since at least 1710. literary works are defined by copyright law to mean any work, other than a dramatic or musical work, which is written, spoken or sung, and accordingly includes (a) a table or compilation (other than a database), (b) a computer program, (c) preparatory design material for a computer program, and (d) a database.

rome ( rohm; italian: roma [ˈroːma], latin: rōma) is the capital of italy and a special comune (named comune di roma capitale). rome also serves as the capital of the lazio region. with 2,877,215 residents in 1,285 km2 (496.1 sq mi), it is also the country's most populated comune. it is the fourth-most populous city in the european union by population within city limits. it is the center of the metropolitan city of rome, which has a population of 4.3 million residents. rome is located in the central-western portion of the italian peninsula, within lazio (latium), along the shores of the tiber. the vatican city is an independent country inside the city boundaries of rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason rome has been often defined as capital of two states.
rome's history spans more than 2,500 years. while roman mythology dates the founding of rome at around 753 bc, the site has been inhabited for much longer, making it one of the oldest continuously occupied sites in europe. the city's early population originated from a mix of latins, etruscans and sabines. eventually, the city successively became the capital of the roman kingdom, the roman republic and the roman empire, and is regarded as the birthplace of western civilisation and by some as the first ever metropolis. it was first called the eternal city (latin: urbs aeterna; italian: la città eterna) by the roman poet tibullus in the 1st century bc, and the expression was also taken up by ovid, virgil, and livy. rome is also called the caput mundi (capital of the world).
after the fall of the western empire, which marked the beginning of the middle ages, rome slowly fell under the political control of the papacy, which had settled in the city since the 1st century ad, until in the 8th century it became the capital of the papal states, which lasted until 1870.
beginning with the renaissance, almost all the popes since nicholas v (1447–1455) pursued over four hundred years a coherent architectural and urban programme aimed at making the city the artistic and cultural centre of the world. in this way, rome became first one of the major centres of the italian renaissance, and then the birthplace of both the baroque style and neoclassicism. famous artists, painters, sculptors and architects made rome the centre of their activity, creating masterpieces throughout the city. in 1871 rome became the capital of the kingdom of italy, which in 1946 became the italian republic.
rome has the status of a global city. rome ranked in 2016 as the 13th-most-visited city in the world, 3rd most visited in the european union, and the most popular tourist attraction in italy. its historic center is listed by unesco as a world heritage site. monuments and museums such as the vatican museums and the colosseum are among the world's most visited tourist destinations with both locations receiving millions of tourists a year. rome hosted the 1960 summer olympics and is the seat of united nations' food and agriculture organization (fao). the city hosts the headquarters of many international business companies, such as eni, enel, tim and national and international banks such as unicredit and bnl. its business district, called eur, is the base of many companies involved in the oil industry, the pharmaceutical industry and financial services. rome is also an important fashion and design center thanks to international brands such as fendi, bulgari, renato balestra, valentino, laura biagiotti. rome's cinecittà studios have been the set of many academy award–winning movies. etymology according to the founding myth of the city by the ancient romans themselves, the long-held tradition of the origin of the name roma is believed to have come from the city's founder and first king, romulus.
however, it is a possibility that the name romulus was actually derived from rome itself. as early as the 4th century, there have been alternate theories proposed on the origin of the name roma. several hypotheses have been advanced focusing on its uncertain linguistic roots:
from rumon or rumen, archaic name of the tiber, which in turn has the same root as the greek verb ῥέω (rhèo) and the latin verb ruo, which both mean flow;
from the etruscan word ruma, whose root is *rum- teat, with possible reference either to the totem wolf that adopted and suckled the cognately named twins romulus and remus, or to the shape of the palatine and aventine hills;
from the greek word ῥώμη (rhōmē), which means strength. history earliest history there is archaeological evidence of human occupation of the rome area from approximately 14,000 years ago, but the dense layer of much younger debris obscures palaeolithic and neolithic sites. evidence of stone tools, pottery and stone weapons attest to about 10,000 years of human presence. several excavations support the view that rome grew from pastoral settlements on the palatine hill built above the area of the future roman forum. between the end of the bronze age and the beginning of the iron age, each hill between the sea and the capitol was topped by a village (on the capitol hill, a village is attested since the end of the 14th century bc). however, none of them had yet an urban quality. nowadays, there is a wide consensus that the city developed gradually through the aggregation (synoecism) of several villages around the largest one, placed above the palatine. this aggregation was facilitated by the increase of agricultural productivity above the subsistence level, which also allowed the establishment of secondary and tertiary activities. these in turn boosted the development of trade with the greek colonies of southern italy (mainly ischia and cumae). these developments, which according to archaeological evidence took place during the mid-eighth century bc, can be considered as the birth of the city. despite recent excavations at the palatine hill, the view that rome was founded deliberately in the middle of the eighth century bc, as the legend of romulus suggests, remains a fringe hypothesis. legend of the founding of rome traditional stories handed down by the ancient romans themselves explain the earliest history of their city in terms of legend and myth. the most familiar of these myths, and perhaps the most famous of all roman myths, is the story of romulus and remus, the twins who were suckled by a she-wolf. they decided to build a city, but after an argument, romulus killed his brother and the city took his name. according to the roman annalists, this happened on 21 april 753 bc. this legend had to be reconciled with a dual tradition, set earlier in time, that had the trojan refugee aeneas escape to italy and found the line of romans through his son iulus, the namesake of the julio-claudian dynasty. this was accomplished by the roman poet virgil in the first century bc. monarchy, republic, empire after the legendary foundation by romulus, rome was ruled for a period of 244 years by a monarchical system, initially with sovereigns of latin and sabine origin, later by etruscan kings. the tradition handed down seven kings: romulus, numa pompilius, tullus hostilius, ancus marcius, tarquinius priscus, servius tullius and tarquinius superbus. in 509 bc the romans expelled the last king from their city and established an oligarchic republic. rome then began a period characterised by internal struggles between patricians (aristocrats) and plebeians (small landowners), and by constant warfare against the populations of central italy: etruscans, latins, volsci, aequi, marsi. after becoming master of latium, rome led several wars (against the gauls, osci-samnites and the greek colony of taranto, allied with pyrrhus, king of epirus) whose result was the conquest of the italian peninsula, from the central area up to magna graecia.
the third and second century bc saw the establishment of roman hegemony over the mediterranean and the east, through the three punic wars (264–146 bc) fought against the city of carthage and the three macedonian wars (212–168 bc) against macedonia. then were established the first roman provinces: sicily, sardinia and corsica, hispania, macedonia, greece (achaia) and africa.
from the beginning of the 2nd century bc, power was contested between two groups of aristocrats: the optimates, representing the conservative part of the senate, and the populares, which relied on the help of the plebs (urban lower class) to gain power. in the same period, the bankruptcy of the small farmers and the establishment of large slave estates provoked the migration to the city of a large number of people. the continuous warfare made necessary a professional army, which was more loyal to its generals than to the republic. because of this, in the second half of the second century and during the first century bc there were conflicts both abroad and internally: after the failed attempt of social reform of the populares tiberius and gaius gracchus, and the war against jugurtha, there was a first civil war between gaius marius and sulla. to this followed a major slave revolt under spartacus, and then the establishment of the first triumvirate with caesar, pompey and crassus. the conquest of gaul made caesar immensely powerful and popular, which led to a second civil war against the senate and pompey. after his victory, caesar established himself as dictator for life. his assassination led to a second triumvirate among octavian (caesar's grandnephew and heir), mark antony and lepidus, and to another civil war between octavian and antony. the former in 27 bc became princeps civitatis and got the title of augustus, founding the principate, a diarchy between the princeps and the senate. rome was established as a de facto empire, which reached its greatest expansion in the second century under the emperor trajan. rome was confirmed as caput mundi, i.e. the capital of the world, an expression which had already been given in the republican period. during its first two centuries, the empire saw as rulers, emperors of the julio-claudian, flavian (who also built eponymous amphitheatre, known as the colosseum) and antonine dynasties. this time was also characterised by the spread of the christian religion, preached by jesus christ in judea in the first half of the first century (under tiberius) and popularized by his apostles through the empire and beyond. the antonine age is considered the apogee of the empire, whose territory ranged from the atlantic ocean to the euphrates and from britain to egypt. after the end of the severan dynasty in 235 the empire entered into 50-year period known as the crisis of the third century during which there were numerous putsches by generals who sought to secure the region of the empire they were entrusted with due to the weakness of central authority in rome. there was the so-called gallic empire from 260-274 and the revolts of zenobia and her father from the mid-260s which sought to fend off persian incursions. some regions - britain, spain and north africa - were hardly affected. instability caused economic deterioration, and there was a rapid rise in inflation as the government debased the currency in order to meet expenses. the germanic tribes along the rhine and north of the balkans made serious, uncoordinated incursions from the 250s-280s that were more like giant raiding parties rather than attempts to settle. the persian empire in the east invaded several times during the 230s to 260s but were eventually defeated.
emperor diocletian (284) undertook the restoration of the state. he ended the principate and introduced the so-called dominate which tried to give the impression of absolute power. the most marked feature was the unprecedented intervention of the state down to the city level: whereas the state had submitted a tax demand to a city and allowed it to allocate the charges, from his reign the state did this down to the village level. in a vain attempt to control inflation he imposed price controls which did not last. he or constantine regionalized the administration of the empire which fundamentally changed the way it was governed by creating regional dioceses (the consensus seems to have shifted from 297 to 313/14 as the date of creation due to the argument of constantin zuckerman in 2002 sur la liste de verone et la province de grande armenie, melanges gilber dagron). the existence of regional fiscal units from 286 served as the model for this unprecedented innovation. the emperor quickened the process of removing military command from governors. henceforth civilian administration and military command would be separate. he gave governors more fiscal duties and placed them in charge of the army logistical support system as an attempt to control it by removing the support system from its control. diocletian ruled the eastern half (with residence in nicomedia). in 296 elevated maximian as augustus of the western half where he ruled mostly from milan when not on the movemediolanum. in 292 he created two 'junior' emeperors, the caesars, one for each augustus, constantius fpr britain, gaul and spain whose see was in trier and licinius in srimium in the balkans. the appointment of a caesar was not unknown: diocletian tried to turn into a system of non-dynastic succession. upon abdication in 305 caesars succeeded and they in turn appointed to colleagues for themselves. after the abdication of diocletian and maximian in 305 and a series of civil wars between rival claimants to imperial power during the years 306-313, the tetrarchy was abandoned. constantine called the great undertook a major reform of the bureaucracy not by changing the structure but by rationalizing the competencies of the several ministries during the years 325-330 after he defeated licinius, emperor in the east at the end of 324.the so-clled edict of milan of 313, actually a fragment of a letter from licinius to the governors fo the eastern provinces, granted freedom of worship to everyone including tp christians and ordered the restoration of confiscated church properties upon petition to the newly created vicars of dioceses. he funded the building of several churches, allowed clergy to act as arbitrators in civil suits (a measure that did not outlast him but were restored in part much later), he transformed the town of byzantium into his new residence, which however, was not officially anything more an imperial residence like milan or trier or nicomedia until given a city prefect in may 359 by constantius ii; constantinople. the creation of constantinople would have a profound effect on europe: it was the bulwark against invasion and conquest from the east for 1000 years. christianity in the form of the nicene creed became the official religion of the empire in 380. it was issued in the name of the three emperors - called the edict of thessalonica - by gratian, valentinian ii and theodosius, who was clearly the driving force behind it. he was the last emperor of a unified empire: after his death in 395 his sons, arcadius and honorius divided the empire into a western and an eastern part. the seat of government in the western roman empire was transferred to ravenna after the siege of milan in 402. during the 5th century the emperors form the 430s mostly resided in the capital, rome.
rome, which had lost its central role in the administration of the empire, was sacked in 410 by the visigoths led by alaric i, but very little physical damage was done, most of which was repaired. the popes embellished the city with large basilicas, such as santa maria maggiore (with the collaboration of the emperors). the population of the city had fallen from 800,000 to 450-500,000 by the time the city was sacked in 455 by genseric, king of the vandals. the weak emperors of the fifth century could not stop the decay, until the deposition of romulus augustus on 22 august 476 marked the end of the western roman empire and, for many historians, the beginning of the middle ages. the decline of the city's population was caused by the loss of grain shipments from north africa, from 440 on, and the unwillingness of the senatorial class to maintain donations to support a population that was too large for the resources available. even so, strenuous efforts were made to maintain the monumental center, the palatine, and the largest baths, which continued to function until the gothic siege of 537. the large baths of constantine on the quirinale were even repaired in 443 (according to rome, an urban history from antiquity to the present, rabun taylor, katherine w. rinne and spiro kostof, 2016 pp. 160–179). however the city gave an appearance overall of shabbiness and decay. population declined to 500,000 by 452 and 100,000 by 500 ad (perhaps larger, though no certain figure can be known). after the gothic siege of 537, population dropped to 30,000, but had risen to 90,000 by the papacy of gregory the great. (rome, profile of a city: 321-1308, richard krautheimer, p. 165.) however, the city gave an appearance of shabbiness. the population decline coincided with the general collapse of urban life in the west in the 5th and 6th centuries with few exceptions. subsidized state grain distributions to the poorer members of society continued right through the 6th century and probably prevented the population from falling further (rome, urban history, pp. 184–185.) the figure of 500,000 is based on the amount of pork, 3,629,000 lbs. distributed to poorer romans during five winter months at the rate of 5lbs per person, enough for 145,000 inhabitants. (novel 36, 2, emperor valeninian iii). middle ages the bishop of rome, called the pope, was important since the early days of christianity because of the martyrdom of both the apostles peter and paul there. the bishops of rome were also seen (and still are seen by catholics) as the successors of peter; he being the first bishop of rome. the city thus became of increasing importance as the centre of the catholic church. after the fall of the western roman empire in 476 ad, rome was first under the control of odoacer and then became part of the ostrogothic kingdom before returning to east roman control after the gothic war, which devastated the city. its population declined from more than a million in 210 ad to 500,000 in 273 to 35,000 after the gothic war, reducing the sprawling city to groups of inhabited buildings interspersed among large areas of ruins, vegetation, vineyards and market gardens.
after the lombard invasion of italy, the city remained nominally byzantine, but in reality the popes pursued a policy of equilibrium between the byzantines, the franks and the lombards. in 729, the lombard king liutprand donated to the church the north latium town of sutri, starting the temporal power of the church. in 756, pepin the short, after having defeated the lombards, gave to the pope temporal jurisdiction over the roman duchy and the exarchate of ravenna, thus creating the papal states. since this period three powers tried to rule the city: the pope, the nobility, together with the chiefs of militias, the judges, the senate and the populace; and the frankish king, as king of the lombards, patricius and emperor. these three parties (theocratic, republican and imperial) were a characteristic of roman life during the entire middle ages. on the christmas night of 800, charlemagne was crowned in rome as emperor of the holy roman empire by pope leo iii: on that occasion the city hosted for the first time the two powers whose struggle for the universal power was to be a constant of the middle ages. in 846, muslim arabs unsuccessfully stormed the city's walls, but managed to loot st. peter's and st. paul's basilica, both outside the city wall. after the decay of carolingian power, rome fell prey to feudal anarchy: several noble families kept fighting against the pope, the emperor and each other. these were the times of theodora and her daughter marozia, concubines and mothers of several popes, and of crescentius, a powerful feudal lord, who fought against the emperors otto ii and iii. the scandals of this period pushed the papacy to reform itself: the election of the pope was reserved to the cardinals, and a reform of the clergy was attempted. the driving force behind this renewal was the monk ildebrando da soana, who once elected pope under the name of gregory vii became involved into the investiture controversy against emperor henry iv. subsequently, rome was sacked and burned by the normans of robert guiscard who had entered the city in support of the pope, who was besieged in castel s. angelo.
during this period, the city was autonomously ruled by a senatore or patrizio: in the 12th century. this administration, as often in the italian cities, evolved into the commune, a new form of social organisation, expression of the new wealthy classes. pope lucius ii had already to fight against the roman commune, and the struggle was continued by his successor pope eugenius iii: then the commune, allied with the nobility, was supported by arnaldo da brescia, a monk who was a religious and social reformer. after the pope's death, arnaldo was taken prisoner by adrianus iv, which marked the end of the comune's autonomy. under pope innocent iii, whose reign marked the apogee of the papacy, the commune liquidated the senate, and replaced it with a senatore, who was subject to the pope.
in this period the papacy played a role of secular importance in western europe, often acting as arbitrators between christian monarchs and exercising additional political powers. in 1266 charles of anjou, who was heading south to fight the hohenstaufen on behalf of the pope, was appointed senator. charles founded the sapienza, the university of rome. in that period the pope died, and the cardinals, summoned in viterbo, could not agree on his successor: the people of the city, angered, unroofed the building where they had met, imprisoning them until they had nominated the new pope: this happening marked the birth of the conclave. in this period the city was also shattered by continuous fights among the noble families: annibaldi, caetani, colonna, orsini, conti, nested in their fortresses built above ancient roman edifices, fought each other to control the papacy.
pope boniface viii, born caetani, was the last pope to fight for the church's universal domain: he proclaimed a crusade against the colonna and in 1300, called for the first jubilee of christianity, which brought to rome millions of pilgrims. however, his hopes were crushed by the french king philip the fair, who took him prisoner and slashed him in anagni, causing his death. afterwards, a new pope faithful to the french was elected, and the papacy was briefly relocated to avignon (1309–1377). during this period the city was neglected, until the power fell in the hand of a plebeian man, cola di rienzo. an idealist and a lover of ancient rome, cola dreamed about a rebirth of the roman empire: after assuming the power with the title of tribuno, his reforms were rejected by the populace. forced to flee, cola could come back among the suite of cardinal albornoz, in charge of restoring the church power in italy. back in power for a short time, he was lynched by the populace, and albornoz could take possession of the city, that in 1377 under gregory xi became again the seat of the papacy. the return of the pope to rome in that year unleashed the western schism (1377–1418), and during the next forty years, the city was prey of the fights which shattered the church. early modern in 1418, the council of constance settled the western schism, and a roman pope, martin v, was elected. this brought to rome a century of internal peace, which marked the beginning of the renaissance. the ruling popes until the first half of the 16th century, from nicholas v, founder of the vatican library, to pius ii, humanist and literate, from sixtus iv, a warrior pope, to alexander vi, immoral and nepotist, from julius ii, soldier and patron, to leo x, who gave his name to this period (the century of leo x), all devoted their energy to the greatness and the beauty of the eternal city, to the power of their stock, and to the patronage of the arts.
during those years the centre of the italian renaissance moved to rome from florence. majestic works, as the new saint peter's basilica, the sistine chapel and ponte sisto (the first bridge to be built across the tiber since antiquity, although on roman foundation) were created. to accomplish that, the popes engaged the best artists of the time, including michelangelo, perugino, raphael, ghirlandaio, luca signorelli, botticelli, and cosimo rosselli. the period was also infamous for papal corruption, with many popes fathering children, and engaging in nepotism and simony. the corruption of the popes and the huge expenses for their building projects led, in part, to the reformation and, in turn, the counter-reformation. alexander vi, for example, was well known for his decadence, extravagance and immoral life. under extravagant and rich popes, rome was transformed into a centre of art, poetry, music, literature, education and culture. rome became able to compete with other major european cities of the time in terms of wealth, grandeur, the arts, learning and architecture.
the renaissance period changed rome's face dramatically, with works like the pietà by michelangelo and the frescoes of the borgia apartments. rome reached the highest point of splendour under pope julius ii (1503–1513) and his successors leo x and clement vii, both members of the medici family. in this twenty-year period, rome became one of the greatest centres of art in the world. the old st. peter's basilica built by emperor constantine the great (which by then was in a dilapidated state) was demolished and a new one begun. the city hosted artists like ghirlandaio, perugino, botticelli and bramante, who built the temple of san pietro in montorio and planned a great project to renovate the vatican. raphael, who in rome became one of the most famous painters of italy, created frescoes in the villa farnesina, the raphael's rooms, plus many other famous paintings. michelangelo started the decoration of the ceiling of the sistine chapel and executed the famous statue of the moses for the tomb of julius ii. rome lost in part its religious character, becoming increasingly a true renaissance city, with a great number of popular feasts, horse races, parties, intrigues and licentious episodes.
its economy was rich, with the presence of several tuscan bankers, including agostino chigi, who was a friend of raphael and a patron of arts. before his early death, raphael also promoted for the first time the preservation of the ancient ruins. the fight between france and spain in europe caused the first plunder of the city in less than five hundred years after the previous sack. in 1527, the landsknechts of emperor charles v sacked the city, putting to an abrupt end the golden age of the renaissance in rome.
beginning with the council of trent in 1545, the church began the counter-reformation as an answer to the reformation, a large-scale questioning of the church's authority on spiritual matters and governmental affairs. (this loss of confidence then led to major shifts of power away from the church.) under the popes from pius iv to sixtus v, rome became the centre of the reformed catholicism and saw the instalment of new monuments which celebrated the papacy's restored greatness. the popes and cardinals of the 17th and early 18th centuries continued the movement by having the city's landscape enriched with baroque buildings.
this was another nepotistic age: the new noble families (barberini, pamphili, chigi, rospigliosi, altieri, odescalchi) were protected by their respective popes, who built for their relatives huge baroque buildings. during the age of enlightenment, new ideas reached also the eternal city, where the papacy supported archaeological studies and improved the people's welfare. but not everything went well for the church during the counter-reformation. there were setbacks in the attempts to restrain the anti-church policies of european powers of the time, the most notable setback perhaps being in 1773 when pope clement xiv was forced by secular powers to have the jesuit order suppressed. late modern and contemporary the rule of the popes was interrupted by the short-lived roman republic (1798–1800), which was built under the influence of the french revolution. the papal states were restored in june 1800, but during napoleon's reign rome was annexed as a département of the french empire: first as département du tibre (1808–1810) and then as département rome (1810–1814). after the fall of napoleon, the church state under the pope was reinstated through the congress of vienna of 1814.
in 1849 another roman republic arose within the framework of the revolutions of 1848. two of the most influential figures of the italian unification, giuseppe mazzini and giuseppe garibaldi, fought for the short-lived republic. rome then became the focus of hopes of italian reunification, as the rest of italy was reunited as the kingdom of italy, with a temporary capital at florence. in 1861 rome was declared capital of italy even though it was still under the pope's control. during the 1860s, the last vestiges of the papal states were under french protection, thanks to the foreign policy of napoleon iii. it was only when this was lifted in 1870, owing to the outbreak of the franco-prussian war, that italian troops were able to capture rome entering the city through a breach near porta pia. afterwards, pope pius ix declared himself as prisoner in the vatican, and in 1871 the capital of italy was finally moved from florence to rome. soon after world war i, rome witnessed the rise of italian fascism, led by benito mussolini, who marched on the city in 1922, eventually declaring a new italian empire and allying italy with nazi germany. mussolini pulled down large parts of the city centre in order to build wide avenues and squares which were supposed to celebrate the fascist regime and the resurgence of classical rome. the interwar period saw a rapid growth in the city's population, which surpassed one million inhabitants. in world war ii, due to its art treasuries and the presence of the vatican, rome largely escaped the tragic destiny of other european cities. however, on 19 july 1943 the san lorenzo district was bombed by anglo-american forces, resulting in about 3,000 immediate deaths and 11,000 wounded of which another 1,500 died. after the fall of mussolini and the italian armistice on 8 september 1943, the city was occupied by the germans and declared an open city until its liberation on 4 june 1944.
rome developed momentously after the war, as one of the driving forces behind the italian economic miracle of post-war reconstruction and modernisation in the 1950s and early 1960s. during this period, the years of la dolce vita (the sweet life), rome became a fashionable city, with popular classic films such as ben hur, quo vadis, roman holiday and la dolce vita filmed in the city's iconic cinecittà film studios. the rising trend in population growth continued until the mid-1980s, when the comune had more than 2.8 million residents. after that, population started to decline slowly as inhabitants began to move to nearby suburbs of rome. government local government rome constitutes a comune speciale, named roma capitale, and is the largest both in terms of land area and population among the 8,101 comuni of italy. it is governed by a mayor and a city council. the seat of the comune is the palazzo senatorio on the capitoline hill, the historic seat of the city government. the local administration in rome is commonly referred to as campidoglio, the italian name of the hill. administrative and historical subdivisions since 1972 the city has been divided into administrative areas, called municipi (sing. municipio) (until 2001 named circoscrizioni). they were created for administrative reasons to increase decentralisation in the city. each municipio is governed by a president and a council of twenty-five members who are elected by its residents every five years. the municipi frequently cross the boundaries of the traditional, non-administrative divisions of the city.
the municipi where originally 20, then 19. in 2013 their number has been reduced to 15.
rome is also divided into differing types of non-administrative units. the historic centre is divided into 22 rioni, all of which are located within the aurelian walls except prati and borgo.
these originate from the regiones of ancient rome, which evolved in the middle ages into the medieval rioni. in the renaissance, under pope sixtus v, they reached again the number of fourteen, and their boundaries were finally defined under pope benedict xiv in 1743.
a new subdivision of the city under napoleon was ephemeral, and there were no sensible changes in the organisation of the city until 1870, when rome became the third capital of italy. the needs of the new capital led to an explosion both in the urbanisation and in the population within and outside the aurelian walls. in 1874 a fifteenth rione, esquilino, was created on the newly urbanised zone of monti. at the beginning of the 20th century other rioni where created (the last one was prati – the only one outside the walls of pope urban viii – in 1921). afterward, for the new administrative subdivisions of the city the name quartiere was used. today all the rioni are part of the first municipio, which therefore coincides completely with the historical city (centro storico). metropolitan and regional government rome is the principal town of the metropolitan city of rome, operative since 1 january 2015. the metropolitan city replaced the old province, which included the city's metropolitan area and extends further north until civitavecchia. the metropolitan city of rome is the largest by area in italy. at 5,352 square kilometres (2,066 sq mi), its dimensions are comparable to the region of liguria. moreover, the city is also the capital of the lazio region. national government rome is the national capital of italy and is the seat of the italian government. the official residences of the president of the italian republic and the italian prime minister, the seats of both houses of the italian parliament and that of the italian constitutional court are located in the historic centre. the state ministries are spread out around the city; these include the ministry of foreign affairs, which is located in palazzo della farnesina near the olympic stadium. geography location rome is in the lazio region of central italy on the tiber (italian: tevere) river. the original settlement developed on hills that faced onto a ford beside the tiber island, the only natural ford of the river in this area. the rome of the kings was built on seven hills: the aventine hill, the caelian hill, the capitoline hill, the esquiline hill, the palatine hill, the quirinal hill, and the viminal hill. modern rome is also crossed by another river, the aniene, which flows into the tiber north of the historic centre.
although the city centre is about 24 kilometres (15 mi) inland from the tyrrhenian sea, the city territory extends to the shore, where the south-western district of ostia is located. the altitude of the central part of rome ranges from 13 metres (43 ft) above sea level (at the base of the pantheon) to 139 metres (456 ft) above sea level (the peak of monte mario). the comune of rome covers an overall area of about 1,285 square kilometres (496 sq mi), including many green areas. topography throughout the history of rome, the urban limits of the city were considered to be the area within the city’s walls. originally, these consisted of the servian wall, which was built twelve years after the gaulish sack of the city in 390 bc. this contained most of the esquiline and caelian hills, as well as the whole of the other five. rome outgrew the servian wall, but no more walls were constructed until almost 700 years later, when, in 270 ad, emperor aurelian began building the aurelian walls. these were almost 19 kilometres (12 mi) long, and were still the walls the troops of the kingdom of italy had to breach to enter the city in 1870. the city's urban area is cut in two by its ring-road, the grande raccordo anulare (gra), finished in 1962, which circles the city centre at a distance of about 10 km (6 mi). although when the ring was completed most part of the inhabited area lay inside it (one of the few exceptions was the former village of ostia, which lies along the tyrrhenian coast), in the meantime quarters have been built which extend up to 20 km (12 mi) beyond it.
the comune covers an area roughly three times the total area within the raccordo and is comparable in area to the entire metropolitan cities of milan and naples, and to an area six times the size of the territory of these cities. it also includes considerable areas of abandoned marsh land which is suitable neither for agriculture nor for urban development.
as a consequence, the density of the comune is not that high, its territory being divided between highly urbanised areas and areas designated as parks, nature reserves, and for agricultural use. climate rome enjoys a mediterranean climate (köppen climate classification: csa), with cool, humid winters and warm, dry summers.
its average annual temperature is above 20 °c (68 °f) during the day and 10 °c (50 °f) at night. in the coldest month – january, the average temperature is 12 °c (54 °f) during the day and 3 °c (37 °f) at night. in the warmest months – july and august, the average temperature is 30 °c (86 °f) during the day and 18 °c (64 °f) at night.
december, january and february are the coldest months, with a daily mean temperature of 8 °c (46 °f).temperatures during these months generally vary between 10 and 15 °c (50 and 59 °f) during the day and between 3 and 5 °c (37 and 41 °f) at night, with colder or warmer spells occurring frequently. snowfall is rare but not unheard of, with light snow or flurries occurring almost every winter, generally without accumulation, and major snowfalls once every 20 or 25 years (the last one in 2012).
the average relative humidity is 75%, varying from 72% in july to 77% in november. sea temperatures vary from a low of 13 °c (55 °f) in february and march to a high of 24 °c (75 °f) in august. demographics in 550 bc rome was the second largest city in italy, with tarentum being the largest. it had an area of about 285 hectares (700 acres) and an estimated population of 35,000. other sources suggest the population was just under 100,000 from 600–500 bc. when the republic was founded in 509 bc the census recorded a population of 130,000. the republic included the city itself and the immediate surroundings. other sources suggest a population of 150,000 in 500 bc. it surpassed 300,000 in 150 bc.
the size of the city at the time of the emperor augustus is a matter of speculation, with estimates based on grain distribution, grain imports, aqueduct capacity, city limits, population density, census reports, and assumptions about the number of unreported women, children and slaves providing a very wide range. glenn storey estimates 450,000 people, whitney oates estimates 1.2 million, neville morely provides a rough estimate of 800,000 and excludes earlier suggestions of 2 million.
after the fall of the western roman empire, the city's population declined to less than 50,000 people. it continued to stagnate or shrink until the renaissance. when the kingdom of italy annexed rome in 1870, the city had a population of about 200,000. this increased to 600,000 by the eve of world war i. the fascist regime of mussolini tried to block an excessive demographic rise of the city, but failed to prevent it from reaching one million people by the early 1930s. population growth continued after the second world war, helped by a post-war economic boom. a construction boom also created a large number of suburbs during the 1950s and 1960s.
in mid-2010, there were 2,754,440 residents in the city proper, while some 4.2 million people lived in the greater rome area (which can be approximately identified with its administrative metropolitan city, with a population density of about 800inhab./km2 stretching over more than 5,000 km²). minors (children ages 18 and younger) totalled 17.00% of the population compared to pensioners who number 20.76%. this compares with the italian average of 18.06% (minors) and 19.94% (pensioners). the average age of a roman resident is 43 compared to the italian average of 42. in the five years between 2002 and 2007, the population of rome grew by 6.54%, while italy as a whole grew by 3.56%. the current birth rate of rome is 9.10 births per 1,000 inhabitants compared to the italian average of 9.45 births.
the urban area of rome extends beyond the administrative city limits with a population of around 3.9 million. between 3.2 and 4.2 million people live in the rome metropolitan area. ethnic groups according to the latest statistics conducted by istat, approximately 9.5% of the population consists of non-italians. about half of the immigrant population consists of those of various other european origins (chiefly romanian, polish, ukrainian, and albanian) numbering a combined total of 131,118 or 4.7% of the population. the remaining 4.8% are those with non-european origins, chiefly filipinos (26,933), bangladeshis (12,154), and chinese (10,283).
the esquilino rione, off termini railway station, has evolved into a largely immigrant neighbourhood. it is perceived as rome's chinatown. immigrants from more than a hundred different countries reside there. a commercial district, esquilino contains restaurants featuring many kinds of international cuisine. there are wholesale clothes shops. of the 1,300 or so commercial premises operating in the district 800 are chinese-owned; around 300 are run by immigrants from other countries around the world; 200 are owned by italians. religion much like the rest of italy, rome is predominantly roman catholic, and the city has been an important centre of religion and pilgrimage for centuries, the base of the ancient roman religion with the pontifex maximus and later the seat of the vatican and the pope. before the arrival of the christians in rome, the religio romana (literally, the roman religion) was the major religion of the city in classical antiquity. the first gods held sacred by the romans were jupiter, the most high, and mars, god of war, and father of rome's twin founders, romulus and remus, according to tradition. other gods and goddesses such as vesta and minerva were honoured. rome was also the base of several mystery cults, such as mithraism. later, after st peter and st paul were martyred in the city, and the first christians began to arrive, rome became christian, and the old st. peter's basilica was constructed in 313 ad. despite some interruptions (such as the avignon papacy), rome has for centuries been the home of the roman catholic church and the bishop of rome, otherwise known as the pope. despite the fact that rome is home to the vatican city and st. peter's basilica, rome's cathedral is the archbasilica of st. john lateran, located to the south-east of the city-centre. there are around 900 churches in rome in total, aside from the cathedral itself, some others of note include: the basilica di santa maria maggiore, the basilica of saint paul outside the walls, the basilica di san clemente, san carlo alle quattro fontane and the church of the gesù. there are also the ancient catacombs of rome underneath the city. numerous highly important religious educational institutions are also in rome, such as the pontifical lateran university, pontifical biblical institute, pontifical gregorian university, and pontifical oriental institute.
in recent years, there has been a significant growth in rome's muslim community, mainly due to immigration from north african and middle eastern countries into the city. as a result of this increase of the local practitioners of the islamic faith, the comune promoted the building of the mosque of rome, which is the largest mosque in western europe, that was designed by architect paolo portoghesi and inaugurated on 21 june 1995. since the end of the roman republic, rome is also the centre of an important jewish community, which was once based in trastevere, and later in the roman ghetto. there lies also the major synagogue in rome, the tempio maggiore. vatican city the territory of vatican city is part of the mons vaticanus (vatican hill), and of the adjacent former vatican fields, where st. peter's basilica, the apostolic palace, the sistine chapel, and museums were built, along with various other buildings. the area was part of the roman rione of borgo until 1929. being separated from the city on the west bank of the tiber, the area was a suburb that was protected by being included within the walls of leo iv, later expanded by the current fortification walls of paul iii/pius iv/urban viii.
when the lateran treaty of 1929 that created the vatican state was being prepared, the boundaries of the proposed territory were influenced by the fact that much of it was all but enclosed by this loop. for some tracts of the frontier, there was no wall, but the line of certain buildings supplied part of the boundary, and for a small part of the frontier a modern wall was constructed.
the territory includes saint peter's square, separated from the territory of italy only by a white line along the limit of the square, where it borders piazza pio xii. st. peter's square is reached through the via della conciliazione, which runs from the tiber to st. peter's. this grand approach was designed by architects piacentini and spaccarelli, for want of benito mussolini and in accordance with the church, after the conclusion of the lateran treaty. according to the lateran treaty, certain properties of the holy see located in italian territory, most notably the papal palace of castel gandolfo and the major basilicas, enjoy extraterritorial status similar to that of foreign embassies. pilgrimage rome has been a major christian pilgrimage site since the middle ages. people from all over the christian world visit vatican city, within the city of rome, the seat of the papacy. the pope was the most influential figure during the middle ages. the city became a major pilgrimage site during the middle ages and the focus of struggles between the papacy and the holy roman empire starting with charlemagne, who was crowned its first emperor in rome in 800 by pope leo iii. apart from brief periods as an independent city during the middle ages, rome kept its status as papal capital and holy city for centuries, even when the papacy briefly relocated to avignon (1309–1377). catholics believe that the vatican is the last resting place of st. peter.
pilgrimages to rome can involve visits to a large number of sites, both within the vatican city and in italian territory. a popular stopping point is the pilate's stairs: these are, according to the christian tradition, the steps that led up to the praetorium of pontius pilate in jerusalem, which jesus christ stood on during his passion on his way to trial. the stairs were, reputedly, brought to rome by st. helena in the 4th century. for centuries, the scala santa has attracted christian pilgrims who wished to honour the passion of jesus. object of pilgrimage are also several catacombs built in the roman age, in which christians prayed, buried their dead and performed worship during periods of persecution, and various national churches (among them san luigi dei francesi and santa maria dell'anima), or churches associated with individual religious orders, such as the jesuit churches of jesus and sant'ignazio.
traditionally, pilgrims in rome and roman citizens thanking god for a grace should visit by foot the seven pilgrim churches (italian: le sette chiese) in 24 hours. this custom, mandatory for each pilgrim in the middle ages, was codified in the 16th century by saint philip neri. the seven churches are the four major basilicas (st peter in vatican, st paul outside the walls, st john in lateran and santa maria maggiore), while the other three are san lorenzo fuori le mura (a palaeochristian basilica), santa croce in gerusalemme (a church founded by helena, the mother of constantine, which hosts fragments of wood attributed to the holy cross) and san sebastiano fuori le mura (which lies on the appian way and is built above roman catacombs). cityscape architecture rome's architecture over the centuries has greatly developed, especially from the classical and imperial roman styles to modern fascist architecture. rome was for a period one of the world's main epicentres of classical architecture, developing new forms such as the arch, the dome and the vault. the romanesque style in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries was also widely used in roman architecture, and later the city became one of the main centres of renaissance, baroque and neoclassic architecture. ancient rome one of the symbols of rome is the colosseum (70–80 ad), the largest amphitheatre ever built in the roman empire. originally capable of seating 60,000 spectators, it was used for gladiatorial combat. a list of important monuments and sites of ancient rome includes the roman forum, the domus aurea, the pantheon, trajan's column, trajan's market, the catacombs, the circus maximus, the baths of caracalla, castel sant'angelo, the mausoleum of augustus, the ara pacis, the arch of constantine, the pyramid of cestius, and the bocca della verità. medieval the medieval popular quarters of the city, situated mainly around the capitol, were largely demolished between the end of the 19th century and the fascist period, but many notable buildings still remain. basilicas dating from the christian antiquity e include saint mary major and saint paul outside the walls (the latter largely rebuilt in the 19th century), both housing precious 4th century ad mosaics. notable later notable medieval mosaics and frescoes can be also found in the churches of santa maria in trastevere, santi quattro coronati, and santa prassede. secular buildings include a number of towers, the largest being the torre delle milizie and the torre dei conti, both next the roman forum, and the huge outdoor stairway leading up to the basilica of santa maria in ara coeli. renaissance and baroque rome was a major world centre of the renaissance, second only to florence, and was profoundly affected by the movement. among others, a masterpiece of renaissance architecture in rome is the piazza del campidoglio by michelangelo. during this period, the great aristocratic families of rome used to build opulent dwellings as the palazzo del quirinale (now seat of the president of the italian republic), the palazzo venezia, the palazzo farnese, the palazzo barberini, the palazzo chigi (now seat of the italian prime minister), the palazzo spada, the palazzo della cancelleria, and the villa farnesina. many of the famous city's squares – some huge, majestic and often adorned with obelisks, some small and picturesque – got their present shape during the renaissance and baroque. the principal ones are piazza navona, piazza di spagna, campo de' fiori, piazza venezia, piazza farnese, piazza della rotonda and piazza della minerva. one of the most emblematic examples of baroque art is the fontana di trevi by nicola salvi. other notable 17th-century baroque palaces are the palazzo madama, now the seat of the italian senate and the palazzo montecitorio, now the seat of the chamber of deputies of italy. neoclassicism in 1870, rome became the capital city of the new kingdom of italy. during this time, neoclassicism, a building style influenced by the architecture of antiquity, became a predominant influence in roman architecture. during this period, many great palaces in neoclassical styles were built to host ministries, embassies, and other governing agencies. one of the best-known symbols of roman neoclassicism is the monument of vittorio emanuele ii or altar of the fatherland, where the grave of the unknown soldier, that represents the 650,000 italians that fell in world war i, is located. fascist architecture the fascist regime that ruled in italy between 1922 and 1943 had its showcase in rome. mussolini allowed the construction of new roads and piazzas, resulting in the destruction of roads, houses, churches and palaces erected during the papal rule. the main activities during his government were: the isolation of the capitoline hill; via dei monti, later renamed via del'impero, and finally via dei fori imperiali; via del mare, later renamed via del teatro di marcello; the isolation of the mausoleum of augustus, with the erection of piazza augusto imperatore; via della conciliazione.
architecturally, fascism favored the most modern movements, such as the rationalism. parallel to this, in the 1920s another style emerged, named stile novecento, characterised by its links with ancient roman architecture. one important construction in the latter style is the foro mussolini, now foro italico, by enrico del debbio. next to it, the most important fascist site in rome is the eur district, designed in 1938 by marcello piacentini. this new quarter emerged as a compromise between rationalist and novecento architects, the former being led by giuseppe pagano. the eur was originally conceived for the 1942 world exhibition, and was called e.42 (esposizione 42). the most representative buildings of eur are the palazzo della civiltà italiana (1938–1943), the iconic design of which has been labelled the cubic of square colosseum, and the palazzo dei congressi, example of rationalist style. the world exhibition, however, never took place because italy entered the second world war in 1940, and the realised buildings were partly destroyed in 1943 during the fighting between italian and german army after the armistice and later abandoned. the quarter was restored in the 1950s, when the roman authorities found that they already had the seed of an off-center business district of the type that other capitals were still planning (london docklands and la défense in paris). also the palazzo della farnesina, the current seat of the italian ministry of foreign affairs, was designed in 1935 in pure fascist style. parks and gardens public parks and nature reserves cover a large area in rome, and the city has one of the largest areas of green space among european capitals. the most notable part of this green space is represented by the large number of villas and landscaped gardens created by the italian aristocracy. while most of the parks surrounding the villas were destroyed during the building boom of the late 19th century, some of them remain. the most notable of these are villa borghese, villa ada, and villa doria pamphili. villa doria pamphili is west of the gianicolo hill comprising some 1.8 square kilometres (0.7 sq mi). also on the gianicolo hill there is villa sciarra, with playgrounds for children and shaded walking areas. in the nearby area of trastevere the orto botanico (botanical garden) is a cool and shady green space. the old roman hippodrome (circus maximus) is another large green space: it has few trees, but is overlooked by the palatine and the rose garden ('roseto comunale'). nearby is the lush villa celimontana, close to the gardens surrounding the baths of caracalla. the villa borghese garden is the best known large green space in rome, with famous art galleries among its shaded walks. overlooking piazza del popolo and the spanish steps are the gardens of pincio and villa medici. noteworthy is also the pine wood of castelfusano, near ostia. rome also has a number of regional parks of much more recent origin including the pineto regional park and the appian way regional park. there are also nature reserves at marcigliana and at tenuta di castelporziano. fountains and aqueducts rome is a city famous for its numerous fountains, built in all different styles, from classical and medieval, to baroque and neoclassical. the city has had fountains for more than two thousand years, and they have provided drinking water and decorated the piazzas of rome. during the roman empire, in 98 ad, according to sextus julius frontinus, the roman consul who was named curator aquarum or guardian of the water of the city, rome had nine aqueducts which fed 39 monumental fountains and 591 public basins, not counting the water supplied to the imperial household, baths and owners of private villas. each of the major fountains was connected to two different aqueducts, in case one was shut down for service.
during the 17th and 18th century the roman popes reconstructed other ruined roman aqueducts and built new display fountains to mark their termini, launching the golden age of the roman fountain. the fountains of rome, like the paintings of rubens, were expressions of the new style of baroque art. they were crowded with allegorical figures, and filled with emotion and movement. in these fountains, sculpture became the principal element, and the water was used simply to animate and decorate the sculptures. they, like baroque gardens, were a visual representation of confidence and power. statues rome is well known for its statues but, in particular, the talking statues of rome. these are usually ancient statues which have become popular soapboxes for political and social discussion, and places for people to (often satirically) voice their opinions. there are two main talking statues: the pasquino and the marforio, yet there are four other noted ones: il babuino, madama lucrezia, il facchino and abbot luigi. most of these statues are ancient roman or classical, and most of them also depict mythical gods, ancient people or legendary figures; il pasquino represents menelaus, abbot luigi is an unknown roman magistrate, il babuino is supposed to be silenus, marforio represents oceanus, madama lucrezia is a bust of isis, and il facchino is the only non-roman statue, created in 1580, and not representing anyone in particular. they are often, due to their status, covered with placards or graffiti expressing political ideas and points of view. other statues in the city, which are not related to the talking statues, include those of the ponte sant'angelo, or several monuments scattered across the city, such as that to giordano bruno in the campo de'fiori. obelisks and columns the city hosts eight ancient egyptian and five ancient roman obelisks, together with a number of more modern obelisks; there was also formerly (until 2005) an ancient ethiopian obelisk in rome. the city contains some of obelisks in piazzas, such as in piazza navona, st peter's square, piazza montecitorio, and piazza del popolo, and others in villas, thermae parks and gardens, such as in villa celimontana, the baths of diocletian, and the pincian hill. moreover, the center of rome hosts also trajan's and antonine column, two ancient roman columns with spiral relief. the column of marcus aurelius is located in piazza colonna and it was built around 180 ad by commodus in memory of his parents. the column of marcus aurelius was inspired by trajan's column at trajan's forum, which is part of the imperial fora bridges the city of rome contains numerous famous bridges which cross the tiber. the only bridge to remain unaltered until today from the classical age is ponte dei quattro capi, which connects the isola tiberina with the left bank. the other surviving – albeit modified – ancient roman bridges crossing the tiber are ponte cestio, ponte sant'angelo and ponte milvio. considering ponte nomentano, also built during ancient rome, which crosses the aniene, currently there are five ancient roman bridges still remaining in the city. other noteworthy bridges are ponte sisto, the first bridge built in the renaissance above roman foundations; ponte rotto, actually the only remaining arch of the ancient pons aemilius, collapsed during the flood of 1598 and demolished at the end of the 19th century; and ponte vittorio emanuele ii, a modern bridge connecting corso vittorio emanuele and borgo. most of the city's public bridges were built in classical or renaissance style, but also in baroque, neoclassical and modern styles. according to the encyclopædia britannica, the finest ancient bridge remaining in rome is the ponte sant'angelo, which was completed in 135 ad, and was decorated with ten statues of the angels, designed by bernini in 1688. catacombs rome has extensive amount of ancient catacombs, or underground burial places under or near the city, of which there are at least forty, some discovered only in recent decades. though most famous for christian burials, they include pagan and jewish burials, either in separate catacombs or mixed together. the first large-scale catacombs were excavated from the 2nd century onwards. originally they were carved through tuff, a soft volcanic rock, outside the boundaries of the city, because roman law forbade burial places within city limits. currently maintenance of the catacombs is in the hands of the papacy which has invested in the salesians of don bosco the supervision of the catacombs of st. callixtus on the outskirts of rome. economy being the capital city of italy, rome hosts all the principal institutions of the nation, like the presidency of the republic, the government (and its single ministeri), the parliament, the main judicial courts, and the diplomatic representatives of all the countries for the states of italy and the vatican city (curiously, rome also hosts, in the italian part of its territory, the embassy of italy for the vatican city, a unique case of an embassy within the boundaries of its own country). many international institutions are located in rome, notably cultural and scientific ones – such as the american institute, the british school, the french academy, the scandinavian institutes, the german archaeological institute – for the honour of scholarship in the eternal city, and specialised agencies of the united nations, such as the fao. rome also hosts major international and worldwide political and cultural organisations, such as the international fund for agricultural development (ifad), world food programme (wfp), the nato defence college and iccrom, the international center for the study of the preservation and restoration of cultural property. rome is currently a beta+ world city, falling down from its alpha- status in 2008, along with berlin, bucharest, athens, lisbon, montreal and budapest. rome was also ranked in 2014 as 32nd in the global cities index, being the highest-ranking city in italy. with a 2005 gdp of €94.376 billion (us$121.5 billion), the city produces 6.7% of the national gdp (more than any other single city in italy), and its unemployment rate, lowered from 11.1% to 6.5% between 2001 and 2005, is now one of the lowest rates of all the european union capital cities. rome grows +4.4% annually and continues to grow at a higher rate in comparison to any other city in the rest of the country. this means that were rome a country, it would be the world's 52nd richest country by gdp, near to the size to that of egypt. rome also had a 2003 gdp per capita of €29,153 (us$37,412), which was second in italy, (after milan), and is more than 134.1% of the eu average gdp per capita. rome, on the whole, has the highest total earnings in italy, reaching €47,076,890,463 in 2008, yet, in terms of average workers' incomes, the city places itself 9th in italy, with €24,509. on a global level, rome's workers receive the 30th highest wages in 2009, coming three places higher than in 2008, in which the city ranked 33rd. the rome area had a gdp amounting to $167.8 billion, and $38,765 per capita. although the economy of rome is characterised by the absence of heavy industry and it is largely dominated by services, high-technology companies (it, aerospace, defence, telecommunications), research, construction and commercial activities (especially banking), and the huge development of tourism are very dynamic and extremely important to its economy. rome's international airport, fiumicino, is the largest in italy, and the city hosts the head offices of the vast majority of the major italian companies, as well as the headquarters of three of the world's 100 largest companies: enel, eni, and telecom italia.
universities, national radio and television and the movie industry in rome are also important parts of the economy: rome is also the hub of the italian film industry, thanks to the cinecittà studios, working since the 1930s. the city is also a centre for banking and insurance as well as electronics, energy, transport, and aerospace industries. numerous international companies and agencies headquarters, government ministries, conference centres, sports venues, and museums are located in rome's principal business districts: the esposizione universale roma (eur); the torrino (further south from the eur); the magliana; the parco de' medici-laurentina and the so-called tiburtina-valley along the ancient via tiburtina. education rome is a nationwide and major international centre for higher education, containing numerous academies, colleges and universities. it boasts a large variety of academies and colleges, and has always been a major worldwide intellectual and educational centre, especially during ancient rome and the renaissance, along with florence. according to the city brands index, rome is considered the world's second most historically, educationally and culturally interesting and beautiful city.
rome has a large number of universities and colleges. its first university, la sapienza (founded in 1303), is one of the largest in the world, with more than 140,000 students attending; in 2005 it ranked as europe's 33rd best university and in 2013 the sapienza university of rome ranked as the 62nd in the world and the top in italy in its world university rankings. and has been ranked among europe's 50 and the world's 150 best colleges. in order to decrease the overcrowding of la sapienza, two new public universities were founded during the last decades: tor vergata in 1982, and roma tre in 1992. rome hosts also the luiss school of government, italy's most important graduate university in the areas of international affairs and european studies. rome isia was founded in 1973 by giulio carlo argan and is italy's oldest institution in the field of industrial design. rome contains also a large number of pontifical universities and other institutes, including the british school at rome, the french school in rome, the pontifical gregorian university (the oldest jesuit university in the world, founded in 1551), istituto europeo di design, the scuola lorenzo de' medici, the link campus of malta, and the università campus bio-medico. rome is also the location of two american universities; the american university of rome and john cabot university as well as st. john's university branch campus, john felice rome center, a campus of loyola university chicago and temple university rome, a campus of temple university. the roman colleges are several seminaries for students from foreign countries studying for the priesthood at the pontifical universities. examples include the venerable english college, the pontifical north american college, the scots college, and the pontifical croatian college of st. jerome. rome's major libraries include: the biblioteca angelica, opened in 1604, making it italy's first public library; the biblioteca vallicelliana, established in 1565; the biblioteca casanatense, opened in 1701; the national central library, one of the two national libraries in italy, which contains 4,126,002 volumes; the biblioteca del ministero degli affari esteri, specialised in diplomacy, foreign affairs and modern history; the biblioteca dell'istituto dell'enciclopedia italiana; the biblioteca don bosco, one of the largest and most modern of all salesian libraries; the biblioteca e museo teatrale del burcardo, a museum-library specialised in history of drama and theatre; the biblioteca della società geografica italiana, which is based in the villa celimontana and is the most important geographical library in italy, and one of europe's most important; and the vatican library, one of the oldest and most important libraries in the world, which was formally established in 1475, though in fact much older and has 75,000 codices, as well as 1.1 million printed books, which include some 8,500 incunabula. there are also a large number of specialist libraries attached to various foreign cultural institutes in rome, among them that of the american academy in rome, the french academy in rome and the bibliotheca hertziana – max planck institute of art history, a german library, often noted for excellence in the arts and sciences; culture entertainment and performing arts rome is an important centre for music, and it has an intense musical scene, including several prestigious music conservatories and theatres. it hosts the accademia nazionale di santa cecilia (founded in 1585), for which new concert halls have been built in the new parco della musica, one of the largest musical venues in the world. rome also has an opera house, the teatro dell'opera di roma, as well as several minor musical institutions. the city also played host to the eurovision song contest in 1991 and the mtv europe music awards in 2004.
rome has also had a major impact in music history. the roman school was a group of composers of predominantly church music, which were active in the city during the 16th and 17th centuries, therefore spanning the late renaissance and early baroque eras. the term also refers to the music they produced. many of the composers had a direct connection to the vatican and the papal chapel, though they worked at several churches; stylistically they are often contrasted with the venetian school of composers, a concurrent movement which was much more progressive. by far the most famous composer of the roman school is giovanni pierluigi da palestrina, whose name has been associated for four hundred years with smooth, clear, polyphonic perfection. however, there were other composers working in rome, and in a variety of styles and forms. tourism rome today is one of the most important tourist destinations of the world, due to the incalculable immensity of its archaeological and artistic treasures, as well as for the charm of its unique traditions, the beauty of its panoramic views, and the majesty of its magnificent villas (parks). among the most significant resources are the many museums – musei capitolini, the vatican museums and the galleria borghese and others dedicated to modern and contemporary art – aqueducts, fountains, churches, palaces, historical buildings, the monuments and ruins of the roman forum, and the catacombs. rome is the third most visited city in the eu, after london and paris, and receives an average of 7–10 million tourists a year, which sometimes doubles on holy years. the colosseum (4 million tourists) and the vatican museums (4.2 million tourists) are the 39th and 37th (respectively) most visited places in the world, according to a recent study.
rome is a major archaeological hub, and one of the world's main centres of archaeological research. there are numerous cultural and research institutes located in the city, such as the american academy in rome, and the swedish institute at rome. rome contains numerous ancient sites, including the forum romanum, trajan's market, trajan's forum, the colosseum, and the pantheon, to name but a few. the colosseum, arguably one of rome's most iconic archaeological sites, is regarded as a wonder of the world.
rome contains a vast and impressive collection of art, sculpture, fountains, mosaics, frescos, and paintings, from all different periods. rome first became a major artistic centre during ancient rome, with forms of important roman art such as architecture, painting, sculpture and mosaic work. metal-work, coin die and gem engraving, ivory carvings, figurine glass, pottery, and book illustrations are considered to be 'minor' forms of roman artwork. rome later became a major centre of renaissance art, since the popes spent vast sums of money for the constructions of grandiose basilicas, palaces, piazzas and public buildings in general. rome became one of europe's major centres of renaissance artwork, second only to florence, and able to compare to other major cities and cultural centres, such as paris and venice. the city was affected greatly by the baroque, and rome became the home of numerous artists and architects, such as bernini, caravaggio, carracci, borromini and cortona. in the late 18th century and early 19th century, the city was one of the centres of the grand tour, when wealthy, young english and other european aristocrats visited the city to learn about ancient roman culture, art, philosophy and architecture. rome hosted a great number of neoclassical and rococo artists, such as pannini and bernardo bellotto. today, the city is a major artistic centre, with numerous art institutes and museums. rome has a growing stock of contemporary and modern art and architecture. the national gallery of modern art has works by balla, morandi, pirandello, carrà, de chirico, de pisis, guttuso, fontana, burri, mastroianni, turcato, kandisky and cézanne on permanent exhibition. 2010 saw the opening of rome's newest arts foundation, a contemporary art and architecture gallery designed by acclaimed iraqi architect zaha hadid. known as maxxi – national museum of the 21st century arts it restores a dilapidated area with striking modern architecture. maxxi features a campus dedicated to culture, experimental research laboratories, international exchange and study and research. it is one of rome's most ambitious modern architecture projects alongside renzo piano's auditorium parco della musica and massimiliano fuksas' rome convention center, centro congressi italia eur, in the eur district, due to open in 2016. the convention centre features a huge translucent container inside which is suspended a steel and teflon structure resembling a cloud and which contains meeting rooms and an auditorium with two piazzas open to the neighbourhood on either side. fashion rome is also widely recognised as a world fashion capital. although not as important as milan, rome is the fourth most important centre for fashion in the world, according to the 2009 global language monitor after milan, new york and paris, and beating london. major luxury fashion houses and jewelry chains, such as valentino, bulgari, fendi, laura biagiotti and brioni, are headquartered or were founded in the city. also, other major labels, such as chanel, prada, dolce & gabbana, armani and versace have luxury boutiques in rome, primarily along its prestigious and upscale via dei condotti. cuisine rome's cuisine has evolved through centuries and periods of social, cultural, and political changes. rome became a major gastronomical centre during the ancient age. ancient roman cuisine was highly influenced by ancient greek culture, and after, the empire's enormous expansion exposed romans to many new, provincial culinary habits and cooking techniques. later, during the renaissance, rome became well known as a centre of high-cuisine, since some of the best chefs of the time, worked for the popes. an example of this could be bartolomeo scappi, who was a chef, working for pius iv in the vatican kitchen, and he acquired fame in 1570 when his cookbook opera dell'arte del cucinare was published. in the book he lists approximately 1000 recipes of the renaissance cuisine and describes cooking techniques and tools, giving the first known picture of a fork.
in the modern age, the city developed its own peculiar cuisine, based on products of the nearby campagna, as lamb and vegetables (globe artichokes are common). in parallel, roman jews -present in the city since the 1st century bc- developed their own cuisine, the cucina giudaico-romanesca. examples of roman dishes include saltimbocca alla romana – a veal cutlet, roman-style; topped with raw ham and sage and simmered with white wine and butter; carciofi alla romana – artichokes roman-style; outer leaves removed, stuffed with mint, garlic, breadcrumbs and braised; carciofi alla giudia – artichokes fried in olive oil, typical of roman jewish cooking; outer leaves removed, stuffed with mint, garlic, breadcrumbs and braised; spaghetti alla carbonara – spaghetti with bacon, eggs and pecorino, and gnocchi di semolino alla romana – semolina dumpling, roman-style, to name but a few. cinema rome hosts the cinecittà studios, the largest film and television production facility in continental europe and the centre of the italian cinema, where a large number of today's biggest box office hits are filmed. the 99-acre (40 ha) studio complex is 9.0 kilometres (5.6 mi) from the centre of rome and is part of one of the biggest production communities in the world, second only to hollywood, with well over 5,000 professionals – from period costume makers to visual effects specialists. more than 3,000 productions have been made on its lot, from recent features like the passion of the christ, gangs of new york, hbo's rome, the life aquatic and dino de laurentiis' decameron, to such cinema classics as ben-hur, cleopatra, and the films of federico fellini.
founded in 1937 by benito mussolini, the studios were bombed by the western allies during the second world war. in the 1950s, cinecittà was the filming location for several large american film productions, and subsequently became the studio most closely associated with federico fellini. today cinecittà is the only studio in the world with pre-production, production, and full post-production facilities on one lot, allowing directors and producers to walk in with their script and walk out with a completed film. language although associated today only with latin, ancient rome was in fact multilingual. in highest antiquity sabine tribes shared the area of what is today rome with latin tribes. the sabine language was one of the italic group of ancient italian languages, along with etruscan, which would have been the main language of the last three kings who ruled the city till the founding of the republic in 509 bc. urganilla, or plautia urgulanilla, wife of emperor claudius, is thought to have been a speaker of etruscan many centuries after this date, according to suetonius' entry on claudius. however latin, in various evolving forms, was the main language of classical rome, but as the city had immigrants, slaves, residents, ambassadors from many parts of the world it was also multilingual. many educated romans also spoke greek, and there was a large greek, syriac and jewish population in parts of rome from well before the empire.
latin evolved during the middle ages into a new language, the volgare. the latter emerged as the confluence of various regional dialects, among which the tuscan dialect predominated, but the population of rome also developed its own dialect, the romanesco. the romanesco spoken during the middle ages was more like a southern italian dialect, very close to the neapolitan language in campania. the influence of the florentine culture during the renaissance, and above all, the immigration to rome of many florentines following the two medici popes (leo x and clement vii), caused a major shift in the dialect, which began to resemble more the tuscan varieties. this remained largely confined to rome until the 19th century, but then expanded to other zones of lazio (civitavecchia, latina and others), from the beginning of the 20th century, thanks to the rising population of rome and to improving transportation systems. as a consequence of education and media like radio and television, romanesco became more similar to standard italian. dialectal literature in the traditional form of romanesco includes the works of such authors as giuseppe gioachino belli (one of the most important italian poets altogether), trilussa and cesare pascarella. it is worth remembering though that romanesco was a lingua vernacola (vernacular language), meaning that for centuries, it did not have a written form but it was only spoken by the population.
contemporary romanesco is mainly represented by popular actors and actresses, such as alberto sordi, aldo fabrizi, anna magnani. carlo verdone, enrico montesano, gigi proietti and nino manfredi.
rome's historic contribution to language in a worldwide sense is much more extensive however. through the process of romanization, the peoples of italy, gallia, the iberian peninsula and dacia developed languages which derive directly from latin and were adopted in large areas of the world, all through cultural influence, colonization and migration. moreover, also modern english, because of the norman conquest, borrowed a large percentage of its vocabulary from the latin language. the roman or latin alphabet is the most widely used writing system in the world used by the greatest number of languages.
rome has long hosted artistic communities, foreign resident communities and a large number of foreign religious students or pilgrims and so has always been a multilingual city. today because of mass tourism, many languages are used in servicing tourism, especially english which is widely known in tourist areas, and the city hosts large numbers of immigrants and so has many multilingual immigrant areas. sports association football is the most popular sport in rome, as in the rest of the country. the city hosted the final games of the 1934 and 1990 fifa world cup. the latter took place in the olympic stadium, which is also the shared home stadium for local serie a clubs s.s. lazio, founded in 1900, and a.s. roma, founded in 1927, whose rivalry in the derby della capitale has become a staple of roman sports culture. footballers who play for these teams and are also born in the city tend to become especially popular, as has been the case with players such as francesco totti and daniele de rossi (both for a.s. roma), and alessandro nesta (for s.s. lazio). atletico roma is a minor team that played in first division until 2012; its home stadium was stadio flaminio. rome hosted the 1960 summer olympics, with great success, using many ancient sites such as the villa borghese and the thermae of caracalla as venues. for the olympic games many new structures were created, notably the new large olympic stadium (which was also enlarged and renewed to host qualification and the final match of the 1990 fifa world cup), the villaggio olimpico (olympic village, created to host the athletes and redeveloped after the games as a residential district), ecc. rome made a bid to host the 2020 summer olympics but it was withdrawn before the deadline for applicant files.
further, rome hosted the 1991 eurobasket and is home to the internationally recognized basketball team virtus roma. rugby union is gaining wider acceptance. until 2011 the stadio flaminio was the home stadium for the italy national rugby union team, which has been playing in the six nations championship since 2000. the team now plays home games at the stadio olimpico because the stadio flaminio needs works of renovation in order to improve both its capacity and safety. rome is home to local rugby union teams such as rugby roma (founded in 1930 and winner of five italian championships, the latter in 1999–2000), unione rugby capitolina and s.s. lazio 1927 (rugby union branch of the multisport club s.s. lazio).
every may, rome hosts the atp masters series tennis tournament on the clay courts of the foro italico. cycling was popular in the post-world war ii period, although its popularity has faded. rome has hosted the final portion of the giro d'italia three times, in 1911, 1950, and 2009. rome is also home to other sports teams, including volleyball (m. roma volley), handball or waterpolo. transport rome is at the centre of the radial network of roads that roughly follow the lines of the ancient roman roads which began at the capitoline hill and connected rome with its empire. today rome is circled, at a distance of about 10 km (6 mi) from the capitol, by the ring-road (the grande raccordo anulare or gra).
due to its location in the centre of the italian peninsula, rome is the principal railway node for central italy. rome's main railway station, termini, is one of the largest railway stations in europe and the most heavily used in italy, with around 400 thousand travellers passing through every day. the second-largest station in the city, roma tiburtina, has been redeveloped as a high-speed rail terminus.
rome is served by three airports. the intercontinental leonardo da vinci international airport is italy's chief airport, is located within the nearby fiumicino, south-west of rome. the older rome ciampino airport is a joint civilian and military airport. it is commonly referred to as ciampino airport, as it is located beside ciampino, south-east of rome. a third airport, the roma-urbe airport, is a small, low-traffic airport located about 6 km (4 mi) north of the city centre, which handles most helicopter and private flights.
although the city has its own quarter on the mediterranean sea (lido di ostia), this has only a marina and a small channel-harbour for fishing boats. the main harbour which serves rome is port of civitavecchia, located about 62 kilometres (39 miles) northwest of the city.
the city suffers from traffic problems largely due to this radial street pattern, making it difficult for romans to move easily from the vicinity of one of the radial roads to another without going into the historic centre or using the ring-road. these problems are not helped by the limited size of rome's metro system when compared to other cities of similar size. in addition, rome has only 21 taxis for every 10,000 inhabitants, far below other major european cities. chronic congestion caused by cars during the 1970s and 1980s led to restrictions being placed on vehicle access to the inner city-centre during the hours of daylight. areas where these restriction apply are known as limited traffic zones (zona a traffico limitato (ztl) in italian). more recently, heavy night-time traffic in trastevere, testaccio and san lorenzo has led to the creation of night-time ztls in those districts. a 3-line metro system called the metropolitana operates in rome. construction on the first branch started in the 1930s. the line had been planned to quickly connect the main railway station with the newly planned e42 area in the southern suburbs, where the 1942 world fair was supposed to be held. the event never took place because of war, but the area was later partly redesigned and renamed eur (esposizione universale di roma: rome universal exhibition) in the 1950s to serve as a modern business district. the line was finally opened in 1955, and it is now the south part of the b line.
the a line opened in 1980 from ottaviano to anagnina stations, later extended in stages (1999–2000) to battistini. in the 1990s, an extension of the b line was opened from termini to rebibbia. this underground network is generally reliable (although it may become very congested at peak times and during events, especially the a line) as it is relatively short.
the a and b lines intersect at roma termini station. a new branch of the b line (b1) opened on 13 june 2012 after an estimated building cost of €500 million. b1 connects to line b at piazza bologna and has four stations over a distance of 3.9 km (2 mi).
a third line, the c line, is under construction with an estimated cost of €3 billion and will have 30 stations over a distance of 25.5 km (16 mi). it will partly replace the existing termini-pantano rail line. it will feature full automated, driverless trains. the first section with 15 stations connecting pantano with the quarter of centocelle in the eastern part of the city, opened on 9 november 2014. the end of the work was scheduled in 2015, but archaeological findings often delay underground construction work.
a fourth line, d line, is also planned. it will have 22 stations over a distance of 20 km (12 mi). the first section was projected to open in 2015 and the final sections before 2035, but due to the city's financial crisis the project has been put on hold.
above-ground public transport in rome is made up of a bus, tram and urban train network (fr lines). the bus, tram, metro and urban railways network is run by atac s.p.a. (which originally stood for the municipal bus and tramways company, azienda tramvie e autobus del comune in italian). the bus network has in excess of 350 bus lines and over eight thousand bus stops, whereas the more-limited tram system has 39 km (24 mi) of track and 192 stops. there is also one trolleybus line, opened in 2005, and additional trolleybus lines are planned. international entities, organisations and involvement among the global cities, rome is unique in having two sovereign entities located entirely within its city limits, the holy see, represented by the vatican city state, and the territorially smaller sovereign military order of malta. the vatican is an enclave of the italian capital city and a sovereign possession of the holy see which is the diocese of rome and the supreme government of the roman catholic church. rome therefore hosts foreign embassies to the italian government, to the holy see, to the order of malta and to certain international organizations. several international roman colleges and pontifical universities are located in rome.
the pope is the bishop of rome and its official seat is the archbasilica of st. john lateran (of which the president of the french republic is ex officio the first and only honorary canon, a title held by the heads of the french state since king henry iv of france). another body, the sovereign military order of malta (smom), took refuge in rome in 1834, due to the conquest of malta by napoleon in 1798. it is sometimes classified as having sovereignty but does not claim any territory in rome or anywhere else, hence leading to dispute over its actual sovereign status.
rome is the seat of the so-called polo romano made up by three main international agencies of the united nations: the food and agriculture organization (fao), the world food programme (wfp) and the international fund for agricultural development (ifad).
rome has traditionally been involved in the process of european political integration. the treaties of the eu are located in palazzo della farnesina, seat of the ministry of foreign affairs, due the fact that the italian government is the depositary of the treaties. in 1957 the city hosted the signing of the treaty of rome, which established the european economic community (predecessor to the european union), and also played host to the official signing of the proposed european constitution in july 2004.
rome is the seat of the european olympic committee and of the nato defense college. the city is the place where the statute of the international criminal court and the european convention on human rights were formulated.
the city hosts also other important international entities such as the idlo (international development law organisation), the iccrom (international centre for the study of the preservation and restoration of cultural property) and the unidroit (international institute for the unification of private law). international relations twin towns and sister cities rome is since 9 april 1956 exclusively and reciprocally twinned only with: paris, france

the city of paris' administrative limits form a horizontal oval centred on its historical-heart Île de la cité island; this island is near the peak of an arc of seine river that divides the city into southern rive gauche (left bank) and northern rive droite regions. paris is but the core of a built-up area that extends well beyond its limits: commonly referred to as the agglomération parisienne, and statistically as a unité urbaine (a measure of urban area), the paris agglomeration's 10,601,122 2013 population makes it the largest urban area in the european union. city-influenced commuter activity reaches well beyond even this in a statistical aire urbaine de paris (a measure of metropolitan area), that had a 2013 population of 12,405,426, a number one-fifth the population of france, and one that makes it, after london, the second largest metropolitan area in the european union. the 2016 metropole of grand paris initiative, encompassing the city of paris and its surrounding petite couronne department communes, or area covering 814 square kilometers and representing a population of 7 million, aims to improve city-suburb cooperation through a unique governing body.
the city is a major rail, highway, and air-transport hub served by two international airports: paris-charles de gaulle (the second busiest airport in europe after london heathrow airport with 63.8 million passengers in 2014) and paris-orly. opened in 1900, the city's subway system, the paris métro, serves 5.23 million passengers daily, and is the second busiest metro system in europe after moscow metro. paris' gare du nord is one of the ten busiest railway stations in the world, with 262 million passengers in 2015.
paris is especially known for its museums and architectural landmarks: the louvre was the most visited art museum in the world in 2016, with 7.4 million visitors. the musée d'orsay and musée de l'orangerie are noted for their collections of french impressionist art, and the pompidou-center musée national d'art moderne has the largest collection of modern and contemporary art in europe. the historical district along seine river in the city center is classified as a unesco heritage site. popular landmarks in the center of the city include the cathedral of notre dame de paris and the gothic royal chapel of sainte-chapelle, both on the Île de la cité; the eiffel tower, constructed for the paris universal exposition of 1889; the grand palais and petit palais, built for the paris universal exposition of 1900; the arc de triomphe on the champs elysees, and the basilica of sacré-coeur on the hill of montmartre. paris received 22.2 million visitors in 2015, making it one of the world's top tourist destinations, but the number of greater paris visitors dropped by 11.5 percent following the terrorist attacks the following year.
the association football club paris saint-germain and the rugby union club stade français are based in paris. the 80,000-seat stade de france, built for the 1998 fifa world cup, is located just north of paris in the neighbouring commune of saint-denis. paris hosts the annual french open grand slam tennis tournament on the red clay of roland garros. paris hosted the olympic games in 1900, 1924 and will host the 2024 summer olympics. the 1938 and 1998 fifa world cups, the 2007 rugby world cup, and the 1960, 1984, and 2016 uefa european championships were also held in the city, and every july, the tour de france bicycle race finishes in the city. etymology the name paris is derived from its early inhabitants, the celtic parisii tribe. the city's name is not related to the paris of greek mythology.
paris is often referred to as the city of light (la ville lumière), both because of its leading role during the age of enlightenment, and more literally because paris was one of the first european cities to adopt gas street lighting. in the 1860s, the boulevards and streets of paris were illuminated by 56,000 gas lamps. since the late 19th century, paris has also been known as panam(e) (pronounced [panam]) in french slang.
inhabitants are known in english as parisians and in french as parisiens ([paʁizjɛ̃]). they are also pejoratively called parigots ([paʁiɡo]). history origins the parisii, a sub-tribe of the celtic senones, inhabited the paris area from around the middle of the 3rd century bc. one of the area's major north-south trade routes crossed the seine on the île de la cité; this meeting place of land and water trade routes gradually became a town and an important trading centre. the parisii traded with many river towns as far away as the iberian peninsula, and minted their own coins for that purpose. the romans conquered the paris basin in 52 bc and, after making the island a garrison camp, began extending their settlement in a more permanent way to paris's left bank. the gallo-roman town was originally called lutetia (more fully, lutetia parisiorum, lutetia of the parisii). it became a prosperous city with a forum, baths, temples, theatres, and an amphitheatre.
by the end of the western roman empire, the town was known as parisius, a latin name that would later become paris in french. christianity was introduced in the middle of the 3rd century ad by saint denis, the first bishop of paris: according to legend, when he refused to renounce his faith before the roman occupiers, he was beheaded on the hill which became known as mons martyrum (latin hill of martyrs), later montmartre, from where he walked headless to the north of the city; the place where he fell and was buried became an important religious shrine, the basilica of saint-denis, and many french kings are buried there.
clovis the frank, the first king of the merovingian dynasty, made the city his capital from 508. a gradual immigration by the franks also occurred in paris in the beginning of the frankish domination of gaul which created the parisian francien dialects. fortification of the Île-de-france failed to prevent sacking by vikings in 845 but paris's strategic importance—with its bridges preventing ships from passing—was established by successful defence in the siege of paris (885–86). in 987 hugh capet, count of paris (comte de paris), duke of the franks (duc des francs) was elected king of the franks (roi des francs). under the rule of the capetian kings, paris gradually became the largest and most prosperous city in france. middle ages to louis xiv by the end of the 12th century, paris had become the political, economic, religious, and cultural capital of france. the palais de la cité, the royal residence, was located at the western end of the Île de la cité. in 1163, during the reign of louis vii, maurice de sully, bishop of paris, undertook the construction of the notre dame cathedral at its eastern extremity.
paris' cultural centre had begun to move to the right bank, after the draining of its former swampland made the land habitable and fit for crops. in 1137, a new city marketplace (where les halles is today) replaced the two smaller ones on the Île de la cité and place de la grève (hotel de ville). the latter location housed the headquarters of paris' river trade corporation, an organisation that later became, unofficially (although formally in later years), paris' first municipal government.
in the late 12th century, philip augustus extended the louvre fortress to defend the city against river invasions from the west, gave the city its first walls between 1190 and 1215, rebuilt its bridges to either side of its central island, and paved its main thoroughfares. in 1190, he transformed paris' former cathedral school into a student-teacher corporation that would become the university of paris and would draw students from all of europe. during the hundred years' war, paris was occupied by england-friendly burgundian forces from 1418, before being occupied outright by the english when henry v of england entered the french capital in 1420; in spite of a 1429 effort by joan of arc to liberate the city, it would remain under english occupation until 1436.
in the late 16th-century french wars of religion, paris was a catholic league stronghold, the organisers of the 24 august 1572 st. bartholomew's day massacre that killed thousands of french protestants. the conflicts ended when crown-pretendant henry iv, after converting to catholicism to gain entry to the capital, entered the city in 1594 to claim the crown of france. this king made several improvements to the capital during his reign: he completed the construction of paris' first uncovered, sidewalk-doted bridge, the pont neuf, built a louvre extension that connected it the tuileries palace, and created the first paris residential square, the place royale, now place des vosges. the king would end his life in the capital, assassinated in a narrow street by les halles marketplace in 1610.
during the 17th century, cardinal richelieu, chief minister of louis xiii, was determined to make paris the most beautiful city in europe. he built five new bridges, a new chapel for the college of sorbonne, and a palace for himself, the palais cardinal, which he bequeathed to louis xiii. after richelieu's death in 1642, it was the renamed as the palais-royal.
due to the parisian uprisings during the fronde civil war, louis xiv moved his court to a new palace, versailles, in 1682. although no longer the capital of france, arts and sciences in the city flourished with the comédie-française, the academy of painting, and the french academy of sciences. to demonstrate that the city was safe from attack, the king had the city walls demolished and replaced with tree-lined boulevards that would become the grands boulevards of today. other marks of his reign were the collège des quatre-nations, the place vendôme, the place des victoires, and les invalides. 18th and 19th centuries paris grew in population from about 400,000 in 1640 to 650,000 in 1780. a new boulevard, the champs-Élysées, extended the city west to Étoile, while the working-class neighbourhood of the faubourg saint-antoine on the eastern site of the city grew more and more crowded with poor migrant workers from other regions of france.
paris was the centre of an explosion of philosophic and scientific activity known as the age of enlightenment. diderot and d'alembert published their encyclopédie in 1751–52, and the montgolfier brothers launched the first manned flight in a hot-air balloon on 21 november 1783, from the gardens of the château de la muette. paris was the financial capital of continental europe, the primary european centre of book publishing, fashion and the manufacture of fine furniture and luxury goods.
in the summer of 1789, paris became the centre stage of the french revolution. on 14 july, a mob seized the arsenal at the invalides, acquiring thousands of guns, and stormed the bastille, a symbol of royal authority. the first independent paris commune, or city council, met in the hôtel de ville and, on 15 july, elected a mayor, the astronomer jean sylvain bailly.
louis xvi and the royal family were brought to paris and made prisoners within the tuileries palace. in 1793, as the revolution turned more and more radical, the king, queen, and the mayor were guillotined, along with more than 16,000 others (throughout france), during the reign of terror. the property of the aristocracy and the church was nationalised, and the city's churches were closed, sold or demolished. a succession of revolutionary factions ruled paris until 9 november 1799 (coup d'état du 18 brumaire), when napoléon bonaparte seized power as first consul. the population of paris had dropped by 100,000 during the revolution, but between 1799 and 1815, it surged with 160,000 new residents, reaching 660,000. napoleon bonaparte replaced the elected government of paris with a prefect reporting only to him. he began erecting monuments to military glory, including the arc de triomphe, and improved the neglected infrastructure of the city with new fountains, the canal de l'ourcq, père lachaise cemetery and the city's first metal bridge, the pont des arts.
during the restoration, the bridges and squares of paris were returned to their pre-revolution names, but the july revolution of 1830 in paris, (commemorated by the july column on place de la bastille), brought a constitutional monarch, louis philippe i, to power. the first railway line to paris opened in 1837, beginning a new period of massive migration from the provinces to the city.
louis-philippe was overthrown by a popular uprising in the streets of paris in 1848. his successor, napoleon iii, and the newly appointed prefect of the seine, georges-eugène haussmann, launched a gigantic public works project to build wide new boulevards, a new opera house, a central market, new aqueducts, sewers, and parks, including the bois de boulogne and bois de vincennes. in 1860, napoleon iii also annexed the surrounding towns and created eight new arrondissements, expanding paris to its current limits. during the franco-prussian war (1870–1871), paris was besieged by the prussian army. after months of blockade, hunger, and then bombardment by the prussians, the city was forced to surrender on 28 january 1871. on 28 march, a revolutionary government called the paris commune seized power in paris. the commune held power for two months, until it was harshly suppressed by the french army during the bloody week at the end of may 1871. late in the 19th century, paris hosted two major international expositions: the 1889 universal exposition, was held to mark the centennial of the french revolution and featured the new eiffel tower; and the 1900 universal exposition, which gave paris the pont alexandre iii, the grand palais, the petit palais and the first paris métro line. paris became the laboratory of naturalism (Émile zola) and symbolism (charles baudelaire and paul verlaine), and of impressionism in art (courbet, manet, monet, renoir). 20th and 21st centuries by 1901, the population of paris had grown to 2,715,000. at the beginning of the century, artists from around the world, including picasso, modigliani, and matisse made paris their home. it was the birthplace of fauvism, cubism and abstract art, and authors such as marcel proust were exploring new approaches to literature.
during the first world war, paris sometimes found itself on the front line; 600 to 1,000 paris taxis played a small but highly important symbolic role in transporting 6,000 soldiers to the front line at the first battle of the marne. the city was also bombed by zeppelins and shelled by german long-range guns. in the years after the war, known as les années folles, paris continued to be a mecca for writers, musicians and artists from around the world, including ernest hemingway, igor stravinsky, james joyce, josephine baker, sidney bechet and the surrealist salvador dalí.
in the years after the peace conference, the city was also home to growing numbers of students and activists from french colonies and other asian and african countries, who later became leaders of their countries, such as ho chi minh, zhou enlai and léopold sédar senghor. on 14 june 1940, the german army marched into paris, which had been declared an open city. on 16–17 july 1942, following german orders, the french police and gendarmes arrested 12,884 jews, including 4,115 children, and confined them during five days at the vel d'hiv (vélodrome d'hiver), from which they were transported by train to the extermination camp at auschwitz. none of the children came back. on 25 august 1944, the city was liberated by the french 2nd armoured division and the 4th infantry division of the united states army. general charles de gaulle led a huge and emotional crowd down the champs Élysées towards notre dame de paris, and made a rousing speech from the hôtel de ville.
in the 1950s and the 1960s, paris became one front of the algerian war for independence; in august 1961, the pro-independence fln targeted and killed 11 paris policemen, leading to the imposition of a curfew on muslims of algeria (who, at that time, were french citizens). on 17 october 1961, an unauthorised but peaceful protest demonstration of algerians against the curfew led to violent confrontations between the police and demonstrators, in which at least 40 people were killed, including some thrown into the seine. the anti-independence organisation armée secrète (oas), for their part, carried out a series of bombings in paris throughout 1961 and 1962. in may 1968, protesting students occupied the sorbonne and put up barricades in the latin quarter. thousands of parisian blue-collar workers joined the students, and the movement grew into a two-week general strike. supporters of the government won the june elections by a large majority. the may 1968 events in france resulted in the break-up of the university of paris into 13 independent campuses.
in 1975, the national assembly changed the status of paris to that of other french cities and, on 25 march 1977, jacques chirac became the first elected mayor of paris since 1793. the tour maine-montparnasse, the tallest building in the city at 57 storeys and 210 metres (689 feet) high, was built between 1969 and 1973. it was highly controversial, and it remains the only building in the centre of the city over 32 storeys high.
the population of paris dropped from 2,850,000 in 1954 to 2,152,000 in 1990, as middle-class families moved to the suburbs. a suburban railway network, the rer (réseau express régional), was built to complement the métro, and the périphérique expressway encircling the city, was completed in 1973.
most of the postwar's presidents of the fifth republic wanted to leave their own monuments in paris; president georges pompidou started the centre georges pompidou (1977), valéry giscard d'estaing began the musée d'orsay (1986); president françois mitterrand, in power for 14 years, built the opéra bastille (1985–1989), the bibliothèque nationale de france (1996), the arche de la défense (1985–1989), and the louvre pyramid with its underground courtyard (1983–1989); jacques chirac (2006), the musée du quai branly. in the early 21st century, the population of paris began to increase slowly again, as more young people moved into the city. it reached 2.25 million in 2011. in march 2001, bertrand delanoë became the first socialist mayor of paris. in 2007, in an effort to reduce car traffic in the city, he introduced the vélib', a system which rents bicycles for the use of local residents and visitors. bertrand delanoë also transformed a section of the highway along the left bank of the seine into an urban promenade and park, the promenade des berges de la seine, which he inaugurated in june 2013.
in 2007, president nicolas sarkozy launched the grand paris project, to integrate paris more closely with the towns in the region around it. after many modifications, the new area, named the metropolis of grand paris, with a population of 6.7 million, was created on 1 january 2016.
in 2011, the city of paris and the national government approved the plans for the grand paris express, totalling 205 kilometres (127 miles) of automated metro lines to connect paris, the innermost three departments around paris, airports and high-speed rail (tgv) stations, at an estimated cost of €35 billion. the system is scheduled to be completed by 2030.
on 5 april 2014, anne hidalgo, a socialist, was elected the first female mayor of paris. recent terror attacks on the 7th of january 2015, two french muslim extremists attacked the paris headquarters of charlie hebdo and killed thirteen people, in an attack claimed by al-qaeda in the arabian peninsula, and on 9 january, a third terrorist, who claimed he was part of isis (also called isil or 'daesh'), killed four hostages during an attack at a jewish grocery store at porte de vincennes. on 11 january an estimated 1.5 million people marched in paris in a show of solidarity against terrorism and in support of freedom of speech. on the 13th of november the same year, a series of coordinated bomb and gunfire terrorist attacks in paris and saint-denis, claimed by the 'islamic state' organisation isil ('daesh', isis);, killed 130 people and injured more than 350.
on the 3rd of february 2017, a two-backpack-carrying, machete-wielding attacker shouting 'allahu akbar' attacked soldiers guarding the louvre museum after they stopped him because of his bags; the assailant was shot, and no explosives were found. on the 18th of march the same year, in a vitry-sur-seine bar, a man held patrons hostage, then fled to later hold a gun to the head of an orly airport french soldier, shouting i am here to die in the name of allah, and was shot dead by the soldier's comrades. on 20 april, a man shot dead french police officer on the champs-Élysées, and was later shot dead himself. on june 19, a man rammed his weapons-and-explosives-laden vehicle into a police van on the champs-Élysées, but the car only burst into flames. geography paris is located in northern central france. by road, it is 450 kilometres (280 mi) southeast of london, 287 kilometres (178 mi) south of calais, 305 kilometres (190 mi) southwest of brussels, 774 kilometres (481 mi) north of marseille, 385 kilometres (239 mi) northeast of nantes, and 135 kilometres (84 mi) southeast of rouen. paris is located in the north-bending arc of the river seine and includes two islands, the Île saint-louis and the larger Île de la cité, which form the oldest part of the city.
the river's mouth on the english channel (la manche) is about 233 mi (375 km) downstream from the city. the city is spread widely on both banks of the river. overall, the city is relatively flat, and the lowest point is 35 m (115 ft) above sea level. paris has several prominent hills, the highest of which is montmartre at 130 m (427 ft). montmartre gained its name from the martyrdom of saint denis, first bishop of paris, atop the mons martyrum, martyr's mound, in 250.
excluding the outlying parks of bois de boulogne and bois de vincennes, paris covers an oval measuring about 87 km2 (34 sq mi) in area, enclosed by the 35 km (22 mi) ring road, the boulevard périphérique. the city's last major annexation of outlying territories in 1860 not only gave it its modern form but also created the 20 clockwise-spiralling arrondissements (municipal boroughs). from the 1860 area of 78 km2 (30 sq mi), the city limits were expanded marginally to 86.9 km2 (33.6 sq mi) in the 1920s. in 1929, the bois de boulogne and bois de vincennes forest parks were officially annexed to the city, bringing its area to about 105 km2 (41 sq mi). the metropolitan area of the city is 2,300 km2 (890 sq mi). climate paris has a typical western european oceanic climate (köppen climate classification: cfb ) which is affected by the north atlantic current. the overall climate throughout the year is mild and moderately wet. summer days are usually warm and pleasant with average temperatures between 15 and 25 °c (59 and 77 °f), and a fair amount of sunshine. each year, however, there are a few days when the temperature rises above 32 °c (90 °f). longer periods of more intense heat sometimes occur, such as the heat wave of 2003 when temperatures exceeded 30 °c (86 °f) for weeks, reached 40 °c (104 °f) on some days and seldom cooled down at night.
spring and autumn have, on average, mild days and fresh nights but are changing and unstable. surprisingly warm or cool weather occurs frequently in both seasons. in winter, sunshine is scarce; days are cool, nights cold but generally above freezing with low temperatures around 3 °c (37 °f). light night frosts are however quite common, but the temperature will dip below −5 °c (23 °f) for only a few days a year. snow falls every year, but rarely stays on the ground. the city sometimes sees light snow or flurries with or without accumulation.
paris has an average annual precipitation of 652 mm (25.7 in), and experiences light rainfall distributed evenly throughout the year. however the city is known for intermittent abrupt heavy showers. the highest recorded temperature is 40.4 °c (104.7 °f) on 28 july 1947, and the lowest is −23.9 °c (−11.0 °f) on 10 december 1879. administration city government for almost all of its long history, except for a few brief periods, paris was governed directly by representatives of the king, emperor, or president of france. the city was not granted municipal autonomy by the national assembly until 1974. the first modern elected mayor of paris was jacques chirac, elected 20 march 1977, becoming the city's first mayor since 1793. the current mayor is anne hidalgo, a socialist, elected 5 april 2014.
the mayor of paris is elected indirectly by paris voters; the voters of each arrondissement elect the conseil de paris (council of paris), composed of 163 members. each arrondissement has a number of members depending upon its population, from 10 members for each of the least-populated arrondissements (1st through 9th) to 36 members for the most populated (the 15th). the elected council members select the mayor. sometimes the candidate who receives the most votes citywide is not selected if the other candidate has won the support of the majority of council members. mayor bertrand delanoë (2001–2014) was elected by only a minority of city voters, but a majority of council members.
once elected, the council plays a largely passive role in the city government; it meets only once a month. the current council is divided between a coalition of the left of 91 members, including the socialists, communists, greens, and extreme left; and 71 members for the centre right, plus a few members from smaller parties.
each of paris's 20 arrondissements has its own town hall and a directly elected council (conseil d'arrondissement), which, in turn, elects an arrondissement mayor. the council of each arrondissement is composed of members of the conseil de paris and also members who serve only on the council of the arrondissement. the number of deputy mayors in each arrondissement varies depending upon its population. there are a total of 20 arrondissement mayors and 120 deputy mayors.
the budget of the city for 2013 was €7.6 billion, of which €5.4 billion went for city administration, while €2.2 billion went for investment. the largest part of the budget (38 percent) went for public housing and urbanism projects; 15 percent for roads and transport; 8 percent for schools (which are mostly financed by the state budget); 5 percent for parks and gardens; and 4 percent for culture. the main source of income for the city is direct taxes (35 percent), supplemented by a 13-percent real estate tax; 19 percent of the budget comes in a transfer from the national government.
the number of city employees, or agents, grew from 40,000 in 2000 to 73,000 in 2013. the city debt grew from €1.6 billion in 2000 to 3.1 billion in 2012, with a debt of €3.65 billion expected for 2014. as a result of the growing debt, the bond rating of the city was lowered from aaa to aa+ in both 2012 and 2013. in september 2014, mayor hidalgo announced that the city would have budget shortfall of €400 million, largely because of a cut in support from the national government. métropole du grand paris the métropole du grand paris, or simply grand paris, formally came into existence on 1 january 2016. it is an administrative structure for co-operation between the city of paris and its nearest suburbs. it includes the city of paris, plus the communes or towns of the three departments of the inner suburbs ( hauts-de-seine, seine-saint-denis and val-de-marne), plus seven communes in the outer suburbs, including argenteuil in val d'oise and paray-vieille-poste in essonne, which were added to include the major airports of paris. the metropole covers 814 square kilometres (314 square miles) and has a population of 6.945 million persons.
the new structure is administered by a metropolitan council of 210 members, not directly elected, but chosen by the councils of the member communes. by 2020 its basic competencies will include urban planning, housing and protection of the environment. the first president of the metropolitan council, patrick ollier, a republican and the mayor of the town of rueil-malmaison, was elected on 22 january 2016. though the metropole has a population of nearly seven million persons and accounts for 25 percent of the gdp of france, it has a very small budget; just 65 million euros, compared with eight billion euros for the city of paris. regional government the region of Île de france, including paris and its surrounding communities, is governed by the regional council, which has its headquarters in the 7th arrondissement of paris. it is composed of 209 members representing the different communes within the region. on december 15, 2015, a list of candidates of the union of the right, a coalition of centrist and right-wing parties, led by valérie pécresse, narrowly won the regional election, defeating a coalition of socialists and ecologists. the socialists had governed the region for seventeen years. the regional council has 121 members from the union of the right, 66 from the union of the left and 22 from the extreme right national front. national government as the capital of france, paris is the seat of france's national government. for the executive, the two chief officers each have their own official residences, which also serve as their offices. the president of the french republic resides at the Élysée palace in the 8th arrondissement, while the prime minister's seat is at the hôtel matignon in the 7th arrondissement. government ministries are located in various parts of the city; many are located in the 7th arrondissement, near the matignon.
the two houses of the french parliament are located on the left bank. the upper house, the senate, meets in the palais du luxembourg in the 6th arrondissement, while the more important lower house, the assemblée nationale, meets in the palais bourbon in the 7th arrondissement. the president of the senate, the second-highest public official in france (the president of the republic being the sole superior), resides in the petit luxembourg, a smaller palace annexe to the palais du luxembourg. france's highest courts are located in paris. the court of cassation, the highest court in the judicial order, which reviews criminal and civil cases, is located in the palais de justice on the Île de la cité, while the conseil d'État, which provides legal advice to the executive and acts as the highest court in the administrative order, judging litigation against public bodies, is located in the palais-royal in the 1st arrondissement. the constitutional council, an advisory body with ultimate authority on the constitutionality of laws and government decrees, also meets in the montpensier wing of the palais royal.
paris and its region host the headquarters of several international organisations including unesco, the organisation for economic co-operation and development, the international chamber of commerce, the paris club, the european space agency, the international energy agency, the organisation internationale de la francophonie, the european union institute for security studies, the international bureau of weights and measures, the international exhibition bureau, and the international federation for human rights.
following the motto only paris is worthy of rome; only rome is worthy of paris; the only sister city of paris is rome, although paris has partnership agreements with many other cities around the world. police force the security of paris is mainly the responsibility of the prefecture of police of paris, a subdivision of the ministry of the interior of france. it supervises the units of the national police who patrol the city and the three neighbouring departments. it is also responsible for providing emergency services, including the paris fire brigade. its headquarters is on place louis lépine on the Île de la cité.
there are 30,200 officers under the prefecture, and a fleet of more than 6,000 vehicles, including police cars, motorcycles, fire trucks, boats and helicopters. in addition to traditional police duties, the local police monitors the number of discount sales held by large stores (no more than two a year are allowed) and verify that, during summer holidays, at least one bakery is open in every neighbourhood. the national police has its own special unit for riot control and crowd control and security of public buildings, called the compagnies républicaines de sécurité (crs), a unit formed in 1944 right after the liberation of france. vans of crs agents are frequently seen in the centre of the city when there are demonstrations and public events.
the police are supported by the national gendarmerie, a branch of the french armed forces, though their police operations now are supervised by the ministry of the interior. the traditional kepis of the gendarmes were replaced in 2002 with caps, and the force modernised, though they still wear kepis for ceremonial occasions.
crime in paris is similar to that in most large cities. violent crime is relatively rare in the city centre. political violence is uncommon, though very large demonstrations may occur in paris and other french cities simultaneously. these demonstrations, usually managed by a strong police presence, can turn confrontational and escalate into violence. cityscape urbanism and architecture most french rulers since the middle ages made a point of leaving their mark on a city that, contrary to many other of the world's capitals, has never been destroyed by catastrophe or war. in modernising its infrastructure through the centuries, paris has preserved even its earliest history in its street map. at its origin, before the middle ages, the city was composed around several islands and sandbanks in a bend of the seine; of those, two remain today: the île saint-louis, the île de la cité; a third one is the 1827 artificially created île aux cygnes.
modern paris owes much to its late 19th century second empire remodelling by the baron haussmann: many of modern paris's busiest streets, avenues and boulevards today are a result of that city renovation. paris also owes its style to its aligned street-fronts, distinctive cream-grey paris stone building ornamentation, aligned top-floor balconies, and tree-lined boulevards. the high residential population of its city centre makes it much different from most other western global cities.
paris's urbanism laws have been under strict control since the early 17th century, particularly where street-front alignment, building height and building distribution is concerned. in recent developments, a 1974–2010 building height limitation of 37 metres (121 ft) was raised to 50 m (160 ft) in central areas and 180 metres (590 ft) in some of paris's peripheral quarters, yet for some of the city's more central quarters, even older building-height laws still remain in effect. the 210 metres (690 ft) montparnasse tower was both paris and france's tallest building until 1973, but this record has been held by the la défense quarter tour first tower in courbevoie since its 2011 construction.
a new project for la défense, called hermitage plaza, launched in 2009, proposes to build two towers, 85 and 86 stories or 320 metres (1,050 feet) high, which would be the tallest buildings in the european union, just slightly shorter than the eiffel tower. they were scheduled for completion in 2019 or 2020, but as of january 2015 construction had not yet begun, and there were questions in the press about the future of the project.
parisian examples of european architecture date back more than a millennium; including the romanesque church of the abbey of saint-germain-des-prés (1014–1163); the early gothic architecture of the basilica of saint-denis (1144), the notre dame cathedral (1163–1345), the flamboyant gothic of saint chapelle (1239–1248), the baroque churches of saint-paul-saint-louis (1627–1641) and les invalides (1670–1708). the 19th century produced the neoclassical church of la madeleine (1808–1842); the palais garnier opera house (1875); the neo-byzantine basilica of sacré-cœur (1875–1919), and the exuberant belle Époque modernism of the eiffel tower (1889). striking examples of 20th-century architecture include the centre georges pompidou by richard rogers and renzo piano (1977), and the louvre pyramid by i.m. pei (1989). contemporary architecture includes the musée du quai branly by jean nouvel (2006) and the new contemporary art museum of the louis vuitton foundation by frank gehry (2014). housing paris is the fifth most expensive city in the world for luxury housing: €18,499 per square metre (€1,720/sq ft) in 2014. according to a 2012 study for the la tribune newspaper, the most expensive street is the quai des orfèvres in the 1st arrondissement, with an average price of €20,665 per square metre (€1,920/sq ft), against €3,900 per square metre (€360/sq ft) for rue pajol in the 18th arrondissement.
the total number of residences in the city of paris in 2011 was 1,356,074, up from a former high of 1,334,815 in 2006. among these, 1,165,541 (85.9 percent) were main residences, 91,835 (6.8 percent) were secondary residences, and the remaining 7.3 percent were empty (down from 9.2 percent in 2006).
paris urban tissue began to fill and overflow its 1860 limits from around the 1920s, and because of its density, it has seen few modern constructions since then. sixty-two percent of its buildings date from 1949 and before, 20 percent were built between 1949 and 1974, and only 18 percent of the buildings remaining were built after that date.
two-thirds of the city's 1.3 million residences are studio and two-room apartments. paris averages 1.9 people per residence, a number that has remained constant since the 1980s, but it is much less than Île-de-france's 2.33 person-per-residence average. only 33 percent of principal residence parisians own their habitation (against 47 percent for the entire Île-de-france): the major part of the city's population is a rent-paying one.
social housing represents a little more than 17 percent of the city's total residences, but these are rather unevenly distributed throughout the capital: the vast majority of these are concentrated in a crescent formed by paris's south-western to northern periphery arrondissements.
in 2012 the paris agglomeration (urban area) counted 28,800 people without a fixed residence, an increase of 84 percent since 2001; it represents 43 percent of the homeless in all of france. forty-one percent were women, and 29 percent were accompanied by children. fifty-six percent of the homeless were born outside france, the largest number coming from africa and eastern europe. the city of paris has sixty homeless shelters, called centres d'hébergement et de réinsertion sociale or chrs, which are funded by the city and operated by private charities and associations. paris and its suburbs aside from the 20th-century addition of the bois de boulogne, bois de vincennes and paris heliport, paris's administrative limits have remained unchanged since 1860. the seine département had been governing paris and its suburbs since its creation in 1790, but the rising suburban population had made it difficult to govern as a unique entity. this problem was 'resolved' when its parent district de la région parisienne (paris region) was reorganised into several new departments from 1968: paris became a department in itself, and the administration of its suburbs was divided between the three departments surrounding it. the paris region was renamed Île-de-france in 1977, but the paris region name is still commonly used today. long-intended measures to unite paris with its suburbs began on january 1, 2016, when the métropole du grand paris came into existence.
paris's disconnect with its suburbs, its lack of suburban transportation, in particular, became all too apparent with the paris agglomeration's growth. paul delouvrier promised to resolve the paris-suburbs mésentente when he became head of the paris region in 1961: two of his most ambitious projects for the region were the construction of five suburban villes nouvelles (new cities) and the rer commuter train network. many other suburban residential districts (grands ensembles) were built between the 1960s and 1970s to provide a low-cost solution for a rapidly expanding population: these districts were socially mixed at first, but few residents actually owned their homes (the growing economy made these accessible to the middle classes only from the 1970s). their poor construction quality and their haphazard insertion into existing urban growth contributed to their desertion by those able to move elsewhere and their repopulation by those with more limited possibilities.
these areas, quartiers sensibles (sensitive quarters), are in northern and eastern paris, namely around its goutte d'or and belleville neighbourhoods. to the north of the city, they are grouped mainly in the seine-saint-denis department, and to a lesser extreme to the east in the val-d'oise department. other difficult areas are located in the seine valley, in Évry et corbeil-essonnes (essonne), in mureaux, mantes-la-jolie (yvelines), and scattered among social housing districts created by delouvrier's 1961 ville nouvelle political initiative.
the paris agglomeration's urban sociology is basically that of 19th century paris: its fortuned classes are situated in its west and southwest, and its middle-to-lower classes are in its north and east. the remaining areas are mostly middle-class citizenry dotted with islands of fortuned populations located there due to reasons of historical importance, namely saint-maur-des-fossés to the east and enghien-les-bains to the north of paris. demographics the population of paris in its administrative city limits was 2,241,346 in january 2014. this makes paris the fifth largest municipality in the european union, following london, berlin, madrid and rome. eurostat, the statistical agency of the eu, places paris (6.5 million people) second behind london (8 million) and ahead of berlin (3.5 million), based on the 2012 populations of what eurostat calls urban audit core cities. the paris urban area, or unité urbaine, is a statistical area created by the french statistical agency insee to measure the population of built-up areas around the city. it is slightly smaller than the paris region. according to insee, the paris urban area had a population of 10,550,350 at the january 2012 census, the most populous in the european union, and third most populous in europe, behind istanbul and moscow. the paris metropolitan area is the second most populous in the european union after london with a population of 12,341,418 at the jan. 2012 census.
the population of paris today is lower than its historical peak of 2.9 million in 1921. the principal reasons were a significant decline in household size, and a dramatic migration of residents to the suburbs between 1962 and 1975. factors in the migration included de-industrialisation, high rent, the gentrification of many inner quarters, the transformation of living space into offices, and greater affluence among working families. the city's population loss came to an end in the 21st century; the population estimate of july 2004 showed a population increase for the first time since 1954, and the population reached 2,234,000 by 2009. according to eurostat, the eu statistical agency, in 2012 the commune of paris was the most densely populated city in the european union, with 21,616 people per square kilometre within the city limits (the nuts-3 statistical area), ahead of inner london west, which had 10,374 people per square kilometre. according to the same census, three departments bordering paris, hauts-de-seine, seine-saint-denis and val-de-marne, had population densities of over ten thousand people per square kilometre, ranking among the ten most densely populated areas of the eu. migration according to the 2012 french census, 586,163 residents of the city of paris, or 26.2 percent, and 2,782,834 residents of the paris region (Île-de-france), or 23.4 percent, were born outside of metropolitan france (the last figure up from 22.4% at the 2007 census).
26,700 of these in the city of paris and 210,159 in the paris region were people born in overseas france (more than two-thirds of whom in the french west indies) and are therefore not counted as immigrants since they were legally french citizens at birth.
a further 103,648 in the city of paris and in 412,114 in the paris region were born in foreign countries with french citizenship at birth. this concerns in particular the many christians and jews from north africa who moved to france and paris after the times of independence and are not counted as immigrants due to their being born french citizens.
the remaining group, people born in foreign countries with no french citizenship at birth, are those defined as immigrants under french law. according to the 2012 census, 135,853 residents of the city of paris were immigrants from europe, 112,369 were immigrants from the maghreb, 70,852 from sub-saharan africa and egypt, 5,059 from turkey, 91,297 from asia (outside turkey), 38,858 from the americas, and 1,365 from the south pacific. note that the immigrants from the americas and the south pacific in paris are vastly outnumbered by migrants from french overseas regions and territories located in these regions of the world.
in the paris region, 590,504 residents were immigrants from europe, 627,078 were immigrants from the maghreb, 435,339 from sub-saharan africa and egypt, 69,338 from turkey, 322,330 from asia (outside turkey), 113,363 from the americas, and 2,261 from the south pacific. these last two groups of immigrants are again vastly outnumbered by migrants from french overseas regions and territories located in the americas and the south pacific.
in 2012, there were 8,810 british citizens and 10,019 us citizens living in the city of paris (ville de paris), and 20,466 british citizens and 16,408 us citizens living in the entire paris region (Île-de-france). religion according to a 2011 survey by ifop, a french public opinion research organisation, 61 percent of residents of the paris region (Île-de-france) identified themselves as roman catholic, though just 15 percent said they were practising catholics, while 46 percent were non-practicing. in the same survey, 7 percent of residents identified themselves as muslims, 4 percent as protestants, two percent as jewish, and 25 percent as without religion. according to insee, the french government statistical office, between 4 and 5 million french residents were born or had at least one parent born in a predominately muslim country, particularly algeria, morocco, and tunisia. an ifop survey in 2008 reported that, of immigrants from these predominantly muslim countries, 25 percent went to the mosque regularly; 41 percent practised the religion, and 34 percent were believers but did not practice the religion.
in 2012, dalil boubakeur, the rector of the grand mosque of paris and former president of the french council of the muslim faith, estimated that there were 500,000 muslims in the city of paris, 1.5 million muslims in the Île-de-france region, and 4 to 5 million muslims in france.
the jewish population of the paris region was estimated in 2014 to be 282,000, the largest concentration of jews in the world outside of israel and the united states. economy the economy of the city of paris is today is based largely on services and commerce; of the 390,480 enterprises in the city, 80.6 percent are engaged in commerce, transportation, and diverse services, 6.5 percent in construction, and just 3.8 percent in industry. the story is similar in the paris region, or Île-de-france. 76.7 percent of enterprises are engaged in commerce and services, and 3.4 percent in industry.
at the 2012 census, 59.5% of jobs in the paris region were in market services (12.0% in wholesale and retail trade, 9.7% in professional, scientific, and technical services, 6.5% in information and communication, 6.5% in transportation and warehousing, 5.9% in finance and insurance, 5.8% in administrative and support services, 4.6% in accommodation and food services, and 8.5% in various other market services), 26.9% in non-market services (10.4% in human health and social work activities, 9.6% in public administration and defence, and 6.9% in education), 8.2% in manufacturing and utilities (6.6% in manufacturing and 1.5% in utilities), 5.2% in construction, and 0.2% in agriculture.
the paris region had 5.4 million salaried employees in 2010, of whom 2.2 million were concentrated in 39 pôles d'emplois or business districts. the largest of these, in terms of number of employees, is known in french as the qca, or quartier central des affaires; it is in the western part of the city of paris, in the 2nd, 8th, 9th, 16th, and 18th arrondissements. in 2010, it was the workplace of 500,000 salaried employees, about thirty percent of the salaried employees in paris and ten percent of those in the Île-de-france. the largest sectors of activity in the central business district were finance and insurance (16 percent of employees in the district) and business services (15 percent). the district also includes a large concentration of department stores, shopping areas, hotels and restaurants, as well a government offices and ministries.
the second-largest business district in terms of employment is la défense, just west of the city, where many companies installed their offices in the 1990s. in 2010, it was the workplace of 144,600 employees, of whom 38 percent worked in finance and insurance, 16 percent in business support services. two other important districts, neuilly-sur-seine and levallois-perret, are extensions of the paris business district and of la défense. another district, including boulogne-billancourt, issy-les-moulineaux and the southern part of the 15th arrondissement, is a centre of activity for the media and information technology.
the top ten french companies listed in the fortune global 500 for 2015 all have their headquarters in the paris region; six in the central business district of the city of paris; and four close to the city in the hauts-de-seine department, three in la défense and one in boulogne-billancourt. some companies, like société générale, have offices in both paris and la défense.
the paris region is france's leading region for economic activity, with a 2014 gdp of € 649.6 billion (us$773.4 billion). in 2011, its gdp ranked second among the regions of europe and its per-capita gdp was the 4th highest in europe. while the paris region's population accounted for 18.8 percent of metropolitan france in 2011, the paris region's gdp accounted for 30 percent of metropolitan france's gdp. in 2015, it hosts the world headquarters of 29 of the 31 fortune global 500 companies located in france.
the paris region economy has gradually shifted from industry to high-value-added service industries (finance, it services, etc.) and high-tech manufacturing (electronics, optics, aerospace, etc.). the paris region's most intense economic activity through the central hauts-de-seine department and suburban la défense business district places paris's economic centre to the west of the city, in a triangle between the opéra garnier, la défense and the val de seine. while the paris economy is dominated by services, and employment in manufacturing sector has declined sharply, the region remains an important manufacturing centre, particularly for aeronautics, automobiles, and eco industries.
in the 2017 worldwide cost of living survey by the economist intelligence unit, based on a survey made in september 2016, paris ranked as the seventh most expensive city in the world, and the second most expensive in europe, after zurich. employment according to 2012 insee figures, 68 percent of employees in the city of paris work in commerce, transportation, and services; 24.4 percent in public administration, health and social services; 4.4 percent in industry, and 0.1 percent in agriculture.
the majority of paris's salaried employees fill 370,000 businesses services jobs, concentrated in the north-western 8th, 16th and 17th arrondissements. paris's financial service companies are concentrated in the central-western 8th and 9th arrondissement banking and insurance district. paris's department store district in the 1st, 6th, 8th and 9th arrondissements employ 10 percent of mostly female paris workers, with 100,000 of these registered in the retail trade. fourteen percent of parisians work in hotels and restaurants and other services to individuals. nineteen percent of paris employees work for the state in either in administration or education. the majority of paris's healthcare and social workers work at the hospitals and social housing concentrated in the peripheral 13th, 14th, 18th, 19th and 20th arrondissements. outside paris, the western hauts-de-seine department la défense district specialising in finance, insurance and scientific research district, employs 144,600, and the north-eastern seine-saint-denis audiovisual sector has 200 media firms and 10 major film studios.
paris's manufacturing is mostly focused in its suburbs, and the city itself has only around 75,000 manufacturing workers, most of which are in the textile, clothing, leather goods, and shoe trades. paris region manufacturing specialises in transportation, mainly automobiles, aircraft and trains, but this is in a sharp decline: paris proper manufacturing jobs dropped by 64 percent between 1990 and 2010, and the paris region lost 48 percent during the same period. most of this is due to companies relocating outside the paris region. the paris region's 800 aerospace companies employed 100,000. four hundred automobile industry companies employ another 100,000 workers: many of these are centred in the yvelines department around the renault and psa-citroen plants (this department alone employs 33,000), but the industry as a whole suffered a major loss with the 2014 closing of a major aulnay-sous-bois citroen assembly plant.
the southern essonne department specialises in science and technology, and the south-eastern val-de-marne, with its wholesale rungis food market, specialises in food processing and beverages. the paris region's manufacturing decline is quickly being replaced by eco-industries: these employ about 100,000 workers. in 2011, while only 56,927 construction workers worked in paris itself, its metropolitan area employed 246,639, in an activity centred largely around the seine-saint-denis (41,378) and hauts-de-seine (37,303) departments and the new business-park centres appearing there. incomes the average net household income (after social, pension and health insurance contributions) in paris was €36,085 for 2011. it ranged from €22,095 in the 19th arrondissement to €82,449 in the 7th arrondissement. the median taxable income for 2011 was around €25,000 in paris and €22,200 for Île-de-france. generally speaking, incomes are higher in the western part of the city and in the western suburbs than in the northern and eastern parts of the urban area. unemployment was estimated at 8.2 percent in the city of paris and 8.8 percent in the Île-de-france region in the first trimester of 2015. it ranged from 7.6 percent in the wealthy essonne department to 13.1 percent in the seine-saint-denis department, where many recent immigrants live.
while paris has some of the richest neighbourhoods in france, it also has some of the poorest, mostly on the eastern side of the city. in 2012, 14 percent of households in the city earned less than €977 per month, the official poverty line. twenty-five percent of residents in the 19th arrondissement lived below the poverty line; 24 percent in the 18th, 22 percent in the 20th and 18 percent in the 10th. in the city's wealthiest neighbourhood, the 7th arrondissement, 7 percent lived below the poverty line; 8 percent in the 6th arrondissement; and 9 percent in the 16th arrondissement. tourism tourism in paris continued to suffer in 2016, after two terrorist attacks in paris in 2015 and an attack in nice in 2016. the number of foreign visitors in grand paris (paris plus the three surrounding departments) dropped by 11.5 percent percent in 2016. the largest drops were in tourists from japan (46.9 percent), russia (35.5 percent), italy (31.9 percent), and china (17.9 percent). the drops were particularly noticeable in the city's museums, especially the louvre, where 70 percent of the visitors are from abroad. attendance at the louvre dropped by 15 percent in 2016: 61 percent fewer japanese visitors, 47 percent fewer brazilian visitors, and 31 percent fewer chinese visitors. visitors from the united states were down by 5.7 percent. similar drops were reported at the musee d'orsay (visitors down by 13 percent from 2015) and the palace of versailles (down by 15 percent).
greater paris received 36.5 million visitors in 2016, measured by hotel stays. the largest numbers of foreign tourists in 2015, measured by airport arrivals, came from the united states (1.8 million), the uk (1.08 million), germany (725,000), italy (622,000), and spain (609,000). arrivals from russia numbered 211,000, while arrivals from the rest of europe numbered 1 million. 746,000 visitors came from china, while 481,000 came from japan. arrivals from the near and middle east numbered 535,000. arrivals from the americas outside the us numbered 910,000, 395,000 arrived from africa, and 1,065,000 arrived from asia and oceania excluding china and japan.
in 2016, measured by the mastercard global cities destination index, paris was the third busiest airline destination in the world, with 18.03 million visitors, behind bangkok (21.47 million) and london (19.88 million). according to the paris convention and visitors bureau, 393,008 workers in greater paris, or 12.4 percent of the total workforce, are engaged in tourism-related sectors such as hotels, catering, transport, and leisure. monuments and attractions the city's top tourist attraction was the notre dame cathedral, which welcomed 12million visitors in 2016 the louvre museum had 7.3 million visitors in 2016, making it the second most visited art museum in the world. after the louvre, the other top museums in paris in 2016 were the centre pompidou (3,3 million visitors), musée d'orsay (3 million visitors), and the national museum of natural history (1.5 million visitors). other top sites in 2016 were the basilique du sacré-cœur (10 million visitors), the eiffel tower (5.9 million visitors, visitors), and the arc de triomphe (1.3 million visitors in the paris region, disneyland paris, in marne-la-vallée, 32 kilometres (20 miles) east of the centre of paris, was the most visited tourist attraction in france, with 13.4 million visitors in fiscal year 2016, though this was a drop of ten percent from visitors in fiscal year 2015.

domestically, air travel between paris and some of france's largest cities such as lyon, marseille, or strasbourg has been in a large measure replaced by high-speed rail due to the opening of several high-speed tgv rail lines from the 1980s. for example, after the lgv méditerranée opened in 2001, air traffic between paris and marseille declined from 2,976,793 passengers in 2000 to 1,502,196 passengers in 2014. after the lgv est opened in 2007, air traffic between paris and strasbourg declined from 1,006,327 passengers in 2006 to 157,207 passengers in 2014.
internationally, air traffic has increased markedly in recent years between paris and the gulf airports, the emerging nations of africa, russia, turkey, portugal, italy, and mainland china, whereas noticeable decline has been recorded between paris and the british isles, egypt, tunisia, and japan. motorways the city is also the most important hub of france's motorway network, and is surrounded by three orbital freeways: the périphérique, which follows the approximate path of 19th-century fortifications around paris, the a86 motorway in the inner suburbs, and finally the francilienne motorway in the outer suburbs. paris has an extensive road network with over 2,000 km (1,243 mi) of highways and motorways. waterways the paris region is the most active water transport area in france, with most of the cargo handled by ports of paris in facilities located around paris. the loire, rhine, rhone, meuse, and scheldt rivers can be reached by canals connecting with the seine, which include the canal saint-martin, canal saint-denis, and the canal de l'ourcq. cycling there are 440 km (270 mi) of cycle paths and routes in paris. these include piste cyclable (bike lanes separated from other traffic by physical barriers such as a kerb) and bande cyclable (a bicycle lane denoted by a painted path on the road). some 29 km (18 mi) of specially marked bus lanes are free to be used by cyclists, with a protective barrier protecting against encroachments from vehicles. cyclists have also been given the right to ride in both directions on certain one-way streets. paris offers a bike sharing system called vélib' with more than 20,000 public bicycles distributed at 1,800 parking stations, which can be rented for short and medium distances including one way trips. electricity paris is provided in electricity through a 'periphery' grid fed by multiple sources.as of 2012, around 50% of electricity generated in the Île-de-france comes from cogeneration energy plants located near the outer limits of the region; other energy sources include the nogent nuclear power plant (35%), trash incineration (9% – with cogeneration plants, these provide the city in heat as well), methane gas (5%), hydraulics (1%), solar power (0.1%) and a negligible amount of wind power (0.034 gwh). a quarter of paris's district heating is to come from a plant in saint-ouen, burning a 50/50-mix of coal and 140,000 tonnes of wood pellets from usa per year. water and sanitation paris in its early history had only the seine and bièvre rivers for water. from 1809, the canal de l'ourcq provided paris with water from less-polluted rivers to the north-east of the capital. from 1857, the civil engineer eugène belgrand, under napoleon iii, oversaw the construction of a series of new aqueducts that brought water from locations all around the city to several reservoirs built atop the capital's highest points of elevation. from then on, the new reservoir system became paris's principal source of drinking water, and the remains of the old system, pumped into lower levels of the same reservoirs, were from then on used for the cleaning of paris's streets. this system is still a major part of paris's modern water-supply network. today paris has more than 2,400 km (1,491 mi) of underground passageways dedicated to the evacuation of paris's liquid wastes.
in 1982, mayor chirac introduced the motorcycle-mounted motocrotte to remove dog faeces from paris streets. the project was abandoned in 2002 for a new and better enforced local law, under the terms of which dog owners can be fined up to €500 for not removing their dog faeces. the air pollution in paris, from the point of view of particulate matter (pm10), is the highest in france with 38 µg/m³. parks and gardens paris today has more than 421 municipal parks and gardens, covering more than 3,000 hectares and containing more than 250,000 trees. two of paris's oldest and most famous gardens are the tuileries garden, created in 1564 for the tuileries palace, and redone by andré le nôtre between 1664 and 1672, and the luxembourg garden, for the luxembourg palace, built for marie de' medici in 1612, which today houses the french senate. the jardin des plantes was the first botanical garden in paris, created in 1626 by louis xiii's doctor guy de la brosse for the cultivation of medicinal plants.
between 1853 and 1870, the emperor napoleon iii and the city's first director of parks and gardens, jean-charles alphand, created the bois de boulogne, the bois de vincennes, parc montsouris and the parc des buttes-chaumont, located at the four points of the compass around the city, as well as many smaller parks, squares and gardens in the paris's quarters. since 1977, the city has created 166 new parks, most notably the parc de la villette (1987), parc andré citroën (1992), and parc de bercy (1997). one of the newest parks, the promenade des berges de la seine (2013), built on a former highway on the left bank of the seine between the pont de l'alma and the musée d'orsay, has floating gardens and gives a view of the city's landmarks. cemeteries in paris's roman era, its main cemetery was located to the outskirts of the left bank settlement, but this changed with the rise of catholicism, where most every inner-city church had adjoining burial grounds for use by their parishes. with paris's growth many of these, particularly the city's largest cemetery, les innocents, were filled to overflowing, creating quite unsanitary conditions for the capital. when inner-city burials were condemned from 1786, the contents of all paris's parish cemeteries were transferred to a renovated section of paris's stone mines outside the porte d'enfer city gate, today place denfert-rochereau in the 14th arrondissement. the process of moving bones from cimetière des innocents to the catacombs took place between 1786 and 1814; part of the network of tunnels and remains can be visited today on the official tour of the catacombs.
after a tentative creation of several smaller suburban cemeteries, the prefect nicholas frochot under napoleon bonaparte provided a more definitive solution in the creation of three massive parisian cemeteries outside the city limits. open from 1804, these were the cemeteries of père lachaise, montmartre, montparnasse, and later passy; these cemeteries became inner-city once again when paris annexed all neighbouring communes to the inside of its much larger ring of suburban fortifications in 1860. new suburban cemeteries were created in the early 20th century: the largest of these are the cimetière parisien de saint-ouen, the cimetière parisien de pantin (also known as cimetière parisien de pantin-bobigny), the cimetière parisien d'ivry, and the cimetière parisien de bagneux. some of the most famous people in the world are buried in parisian cemeteries. healthcare health care and emergency medical service in the city of paris and its suburbs are provided by the assistance publique – hôpitaux de paris (ap-hp), a public hospital system that employs more than 90,000 people (including practitioners, support personnel, and administrators) in 44 hospitals. it is the largest hospital system in europe. it provides health care, teaching, research, prevention, education and emergency medical service in 52 branches of medicine. the hospitals receive more than 5.8 million annual patient visits.
one of the most notable hospitals is the hôtel-dieu, founded in 651, the oldest hospital in the city. other hospitals include pitié-salpêtrière hospital (one of the largest in europe), hôpital cochin, hôpital bichat, hôpital européen georges-pompidou, bicêtre hospital, beaujon hospital, the curie institute, lariboisière hospital, necker-enfants malades hospital, hôpital saint-louis, hôpital de la charité and the american hospital of paris. media paris and its close suburbs is home to numerous newspapers, magazines and publications including le monde, le figaro, libération, le nouvel observateur, le canard enchaîné, la croix, pariscope, le parisien (in saint-ouen), les Échos, paris match (neuilly-sur-seine), réseaux & télécoms, reuters france, and l'officiel des spectacles. france's two most prestigious newspapers, le monde and le figaro, are the centrepieces of the parisian publishing industry. agence france-presse is france's oldest, and one of the world's oldest, continually operating news agencies. afp, as it is colloquially abbreviated, maintains its headquarters in paris, as it has since 1835. france 24 is a television news channel owned and operated by the french government, and is based in paris. another news agency is france diplomatie, owned and operated by the ministry of foreign and european affairs, and pertains solely to diplomatic news and occurrences.
the most-viewed network in france, tf1, is in nearby boulogne-billancourt. france 2, france 3, canal+, france 5, m6 (neuilly-sur-seine), arte, d8, w9, nt1, nrj 12, la chaîne parlementaire, france 4, bfm tv, and gulli are other stations located in and around the capital. radio france, france's public radio broadcaster, and its various channels, is headquartered in paris's 16th arrondissement. radio france internationale, another public broadcaster is also based in the city. paris also holds the headquarters of the la poste, france's national postal carrier. international relations twin towns and partner cities paris is since april 9, 1956 exclusively and reciprocally twinned only with: rome, italy, 1956

history of paris
berlin (, german: [bɛɐ̯ˈliːn]) is the capital and the largest city of germany as well as one of its 16 constituent states. with a population of approximately 3.7 million, berlin is the second most populous city proper in the european union and the seventh most populous urban area in the european union. located in northeastern germany on the banks of the rivers spree and havel, it is the centre of the berlin-brandenburg metropolitan region, which has roughly 6 million residents from more than 180 nations. due to its location in the european plain, berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. around one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers, canals and lakes.
first documented in the 13th century and situated at the crossing of two important historic trade routes, berlin became the capital of the margraviate of brandenburg (1417–1701), the kingdom of prussia (1701–1918), the german empire (1871–1918), the weimar republic (1919–1933) and the third reich (1933–1945). berlin in the 1920s was the third largest municipality in the world. after world war ii and its subsequent occupation by the victorious countries, the city was divided; east berlin was declared capital of east germany, while west berlin became a de facto west german exclave, surrounded by the berlin wall (1961–1989) and east german territory. following german reunification in 1990, berlin once again became the capital of all of germany.
berlin is an international city of culture, politics, media and science. its economy is based on high-tech firms and the service sector, encompassing a diverse range of creative industries, research facilities, media corporations and convention venues. berlin serves as a continental hub for air and rail traffic and has a highly complex public transportation network. the metropolis is a popular tourist destination. significant industries also include it, pharmaceuticals, biomedical engineering, clean tech, biotechnology, construction and electronics.
modern berlin is home to world renowned universities, orchestras, museums, entertainment venues and is host to many sporting events. its urban setting has made it a sought-after location for international film productions. the city is well known for its festivals, diverse architecture, nightlife, contemporary arts and a high quality of living. since the 2000s berlin has seen the emergence of a cosmopolitan entrepreneurial scene. history etymology the name berlin has its roots in the language of west slavic inhabitants of the area of today's berlin, and may be related to the old polabian stem berl-/birl- (swamp). all german place names ending on -ow, -itz and -in, of which there are many east of the river elbe, are of slavic origin (germania slavica). there are many boroughs of slavic origin in the city: berlin-karow, berlin-malchow, berlin-pankow, berlin-spandau (earlier: spandow), berlin-gatow, berlin-kladow, berlin-steglitz, berlin-lankwitz, berlin-britz, berlin-buckow, berlin-rudow, berlin-alt-treptow, berlin-schmöckwitz, berlin-marzahn and berlin-köpenick. since the ber- at the beginning sounds like the german word bär (bear), a bear appears in the coat of arms of the city. it is therefore a canting arm. 12th to 16th centuries the earliest evidence of settlements in the area of today's berlin are a wooden rod dated from approximately 1192 and leftovers of wooden houseparts dated to 1174 found in a 2012 excavation in berlin mitte. the first written records of towns in the area of present-day berlin date from the late 12th century. spandau is first mentioned in 1197 and köpenick in 1209, although these areas did not join berlin until 1920. the central part of berlin can be traced back to two towns. cölln on the fischerinsel is first mentioned in a 1237 document, and berlin, across the spree in what is now called the nikolaiviertel, is referenced in a document from 1244. 1237 is considered the founding date of the city. the two towns over time formed close economic and social ties, and profited from the staple right on the two important trade routes via imperii and from bruges to novgorod. in 1307, they formed an alliance with a common external policy, their internal administrations still being separated.
in 1415 frederick i became the elector of the margraviate of brandenburg, which he ruled until 1440. during the 15th century, his successors established berlin-cölln as capital of the margraviate, and subsequent members of the hohenzollern family ruled in berlin until 1918, first as electors of brandenburg, then as kings of prussia, and eventually as german emperors. in 1443 frederick ii irontooth started the construction of a new royal palace in the twin city berlin-cölln. the protests of the town citizens against the building culminated in 1448, in the berlin indignation (berliner unwille). this protest was not successful and the citizenry lost many of its political and economic privileges. after the royal palace was finished in 1451, it gradually came into use. from 1470, with the new elector albrecht iii achilles, berlin-cölln became the new royal residence. officially, the berlin-cölln palace became permanent residence of the brandenburg electors of the hohenzollerns from 1486, when john cicero came to power. berlin-cölln, however, had to give up its status as a free hanseatic city. in 1539, the electors and the city officially became lutheran. 17th to 19th centuries the thirty years' war between 1618 and 1648 devastated berlin. one third of its houses were damaged or destroyed, and the city lost half of its population. frederick william, known as the great elector, who had succeeded his father george william as ruler in 1640, initiated a policy of promoting immigration and religious tolerance. with the edict of potsdam in 1685, frederick william offered asylum to the french huguenots. by 1700, approximately 30 percent of berlin's residents were french, because of the huguenot immigration. many other immigrants came from bohemia, poland, and salzburg. since 1618 the margraviate of brandenburg had been in personal union with the duchy of prussia. in 1701 the dual state formed the kingdom of prussia, as frederick iii, elector of brandenburg crowned himself as king frederick i in prussia. berlin became the capital of the new kingdom, replacing königsberg. this was a successful attempt to centralise the capital in the very far-flung state, and it was the first time the city began to grow. in 1709, berlin merged with the four cities of cölln, friedrichswerder, friedrichstadt and dorotheenstadt under the name berlin, haupt- und residenzstadt berlin.
in 1740 frederick ii, known as frederick the great (1740–1786), came to power. under the rule of frederick ii, berlin became a center of the enlightenment, but also, was briefly occupied during the seven years' war by the russian army. following france's victory in the war of the fourth coalition, napoleon bonaparte marched into berlin in 1806, but granted self-government to the city. in 1815 the city became part of the new province of brandenburg.
the industrial revolution transformed berlin during the 19th century; the city's economy and population expanded dramatically, and it became the main railway hub and economic centre of germany. additional suburbs soon developed and increased the area and population of berlin. in 1861 neighbouring suburbs including wedding, moabit and several others were incorporated into berlin. in 1871 berlin became capital of the newly founded german empire. in 1881 it became a city district separate from brandenburg. 20th to 21st centuries in the early 20th century, berlin had become a fertile ground for the german expressionist movement. in fields such as architecture, painting and cinema new forms of artistic styles were invented. at the end of the first world war in 1918, a republic was proclaimed by philipp scheidemann at the reichstag building. in 1920 the greater berlin act incorporated dozens of suburban cities, villages and estates around berlin into an expanded city. the act increased the area of berlin from 66 to 883 km2 (25 to 341 sq mi). the population almost doubled and berlin had a population of around four million. during the weimar era, berlin underwent political unrest due to economic uncertainties, but also became a renowned centre of the roaring twenties. the metropolis experienced its heyday as a major world capital and was known for its leadership roles in science, technology, arts, the humanities, city planning, film, higher education, government and industries. albert einstein rose to public prominence during his years in berlin, being awarded the nobel prize for physics in 1921. in 1933 adolf hitler and the nazi party came to power. nsdap rule diminished berlin's jewish community from 160,000 (one-third of all jews in the country) to about 80,000 as a result of emigration between 1933 and 1939. after kristallnacht in 1938, thousands of the city's jews were imprisoned in the nearby sachsenhausen concentration camp. starting in early 1943, many were shipped to death camps, such as auschwitz. during world war ii, large parts of berlin were destroyed in the 1943–45 air raids and during the battle of berlin. around 125,000 civilians were killed. after the end of the war in europe in may 1945, berlin received large numbers of refugees from the eastern provinces. the victorious powers divided the city into four sectors, analogous to the occupation zones into which germany was divided. the sectors of the western allies (the united states, the united kingdom and france) formed west berlin, while the soviet sector formed east berlin. all four allies shared administrative responsibilities for berlin. however, in 1948, when the western allies extended the currency reform in the western zones of germany to the three western sectors of berlin, the soviet union imposed a blockade on the access routes to and from west berlin, which lay entirely inside soviet-controlled territory. the berlin airlift, conducted by the three western allies, overcame this blockade by supplying food and other supplies to the city from june 1948 to may 1949. in 1949 the federal republic of germany was founded in west germany and eventually included all of the american, british and french zones, excluding those three countries' zones in berlin, while the marxist-leninist german democratic republic was proclaimed in east germany. west berlin officially remained an occupied city, but it politically was aligned with the federal republic of germany despite west berlin's geographic isolation. airline service to west berlin was granted only to american, british and french airlines. the founding of the two german states increased cold war tensions. west berlin was surrounded by east german territory, and east germany proclaimed the eastern part as its capital, a move that was not recognised by the western powers. east berlin included most of the historic centre of the city. the west german government established itself in bonn. in 1961 east germany began the building of the berlin wall between east and west berlin, and events escalated to a tank standoff at checkpoint charlie. west berlin was now de facto a part of west germany with a unique legal status, while east berlin was de facto a part of east germany. john f. kennedy gave his ich bin ein berliner – speech in 1963 underlining the us support for the western part of the city. berlin was completely divided. although it was possible for westerners to pass from one to the other side through strictly controlled checkpoints, for most easterners travel to west berlin or west germany was prohibited by the government of east germany. in 1971, a four-power agreement guaranteed access to and from west berlin by car or train through east germany.
in 1989, with the end of the cold war and pressure from the east german population, the berlin wall fell on 9 november and was subsequently mostly demolished. today, the east side gallery preserves a large portion of the wall. on 3 october 1990, the two parts of germany were reunified as the federal republic of germany and berlin again became the official german capital. in 1991, the german parliament, the bundestag, voted to move the seat of the german capital from bonn to berlin, which was completed in 1999. on 18 june 1994 soldiers from the united states, france and britain marched in a parade which was part of the ceremonies to mark the final withdrawal of foreign troops allowing a reunified berlin. berlin's 2001 administrative reform merged several districts. the number of boroughs was reduced from 23 to 12. in 2006, the fifa world cup final was held in berlin. geography topography berlin is situated in northeastern germany, in an area of low-lying marshy woodlands with a mainly flat topography, part of the vast northern european plain which stretches all the way from northern france to western russia. the berliner urstromtal (an ice age glacial valley), between the low barnim plateau to the north and the teltow plateau to the south, was formed by meltwater flowing from ice sheets at the end of the last weichselian glaciation. the spree follows this valley now. in spandau, a borough in the west of berlin, the spree empties into the river havel, which flows from north to south through western berlin. the course of the havel is more like a chain of lakes, the largest being the tegeler see and the großer wannsee. a series of lakes also feeds into the upper spree, which flows through the großer müggelsee in eastern berlin.
substantial parts of present-day berlin extend onto the low plateaus on both sides of the spree valley. large parts of the boroughs reinickendorf and pankow lie on the barnim plateau, while most of the boroughs of charlottenburg-wilmersdorf, steglitz-zehlendorf, tempelhof-schöneberg, and neukölln lie on the teltow plateau.
the borough of spandau lies partly within the berlin glacial valley and partly on the nauen plain, which stretches to the west of berlin. since 2015, the highest elevation in berlin is found on the arkenberge hills in pankow, at 122 metres (400 feet). through the dumping of construction debris, they surpassed teufelsberg (120.1 m or 394 ft), a hill made of rubble from the ruins of the second world war. the highest natural elevation is found on the müggelberge at 114.7 metres (376 feet), and the lowest at the spektesee in spandau, at 28.1 metres (92 feet). climate berlin has a maritime temperate climate (cfb) according to the köppen climate classification system. there are significant influences of mild continental climate due to its inland position, with frosts being common in winter and there being larger temperature differences between seasons than typical for many oceanic climates. furthermore, berlin is classified as a temperate continental climate (dc) under the trewartha climate scheme.
summers are warm and sometimes humid with average high temperatures of 22–25 °c (72–77 °f) and lows of 12–14 °c (54–57 °f). winters are cool with average high temperatures of 3 °c (37 °f) and lows of −2 to 0 °c (28 to 32 °f). spring and autumn are generally chilly to mild. berlin's built-up area creates a microclimate, with heat stored by the city's buildings and pavement. temperatures can be 4 °c (7 °f) higher in the city than in the surrounding areas.
annual precipitation is 570 millimeters (22 in) with moderate rainfall throughout the year. snowfall mainly occurs from december through march. cityscape berlin's history has left the city with a polycentric organization and a highly eclectic array of architecture and buildings. the city's appearance today is predominantly shaped by the key role it played in germany's history in the 20th century. each of the national governments based in berlin – the kingdom of prussia, the 1871 german empire, the weimar republic, nazi germany, east germany, and now the reunified germany – initiated ambitious reconstruction programs, with each adding its own distinctive style to the city's architecture.
berlin was devastated by bombing raids, fires and street battles during world war ii, and many of the buildings that had remained after the war were demolished in the post-war period in both west and east berlin. much of this demolition was initiated by municipal architecture programs to build new residential or business quarters and main roads. many ornaments of pre-war buildings were destroyed following modernist dogmas. while in both systems and in reunified berlin, various important heritage monuments were also (partly) reconstructed, including the forum fridericianum with e.g., the state opera (1955), charlottenburg palace (1957), the main monuments of the gendarmenmarkt (1980s), kommandantur (2003) and the project to reconstruct the baroque façades of the city palace. a number of new buildings are inspired by historical predecessors or the general classical style of berlin, such as hotel adlon.
clusters of high-rise buildings emerge at disperse locations, e.g. potsdamer platz, city west, and alexanderplatz, the latter two representing the previous centers of west and east berlin, respectively, and the former representing the new berlin of the 21st century built upon the previous no-man's land of the berlin wall. berlin has three of the top 40 tallest buildings in germany. architecture the fernsehturm (tv tower) at alexanderplatz in mitte is among the tallest structures in the european union at 368 m (1,207 ft). built in 1969, it is visible throughout most of the central districts of berlin. the city can be viewed from its 204 m (669 ft) high observation floor. starting here the karl-marx-allee heads east, an avenue lined by monumental residential buildings, designed in the socialist classicism style. adjacent to this area is the rotes rathaus (city hall), with its distinctive red-brick architecture. in front of it is the neptunbrunnen, a fountain featuring a mythological group of tritons, personifications of the four main prussian rivers and neptune on top of it. the brandenburg gate is an iconic landmark of berlin and germany; it stands as a symbol of eventful european history and of unity and peace. the reichstag building is the traditional seat of the german parliament. it was remodelled by british architect norman foster in the 1990s and features a glass dome over the session area, which allows free public access to the parliamentary proceedings and magnificent views of the city.
the east side gallery is an open-air exhibition of art painted directly on the last existing portions of the berlin wall. it is the largest remaining evidence of the city's historical division.
the gendarmenmarkt is a neoclassical square in berlin, the name of which derives from the headquarters of the famous gens d'armes regiment located here in the 18th century. it is bordered by two similarly designed cathedrals, the französischer dom with its observation platform and the deutscher dom. the konzerthaus (concert hall), home of the berlin symphony orchestra, stands between the two cathedrals. the museum island in the river spree houses five museums built from 1830 to 1930 and is a unesco world heritage site. restoration and the construction of a main entrance to all museums, as well as the reconstruction of the stadtschloss is continuing. also located on the island and adjacent to the lustgarten and palace is berlin cathedral, emperor william ii's ambitious attempt to create a protestant counterpart to st. peter's basilica in rome. a large crypt houses the remains of some of the earlier prussian royal family. st. hedwig's cathedral is berlin's roman catholic cathedral. unter den linden is a tree-lined east–west avenue from the brandenburg gate to the site of the former berliner stadtschloss, and was once berlin's premier promenade. many classical buildings line the street and part of humboldt university is located there. friedrichstraße was berlin's legendary street during the golden twenties. it combines 20th-century traditions with the modern architecture of today's berlin. potsdamer platz is an entire quarter built from scratch after 1995 after the wall came down. to the west of potsdamer platz is the kulturforum, which houses the gemäldegalerie, and is flanked by the neue nationalgalerie and the berliner philharmonie. the memorial to the murdered jews of europe, a holocaust memorial, is situated to the north.
the area around hackescher markt is home to fashionable culture, with countless clothing outlets, clubs, bars, and galleries. this includes the hackesche höfe, a conglomeration of buildings around several courtyards, reconstructed around 1996. the nearby new synagogue is the center of jewish culture. the straße des 17. juni, connecting the brandenburg gate and ernst-reuter-platz, serves as the central east-west axis. its name commemorates the uprisings in east berlin of 17 june 1953. approximately halfway from the brandenburg gate is the großer stern, a circular traffic island on which the siegessäule (victory column) is situated. this monument, built to commemorate prussia's victories, was relocated in 1938–39 from its previous position in front of the reichstag.

london is the capital and most populous city of england and the united kingdom.
standing on the river thames in the south east of the island of great britain, london has been a major settlement for two millennia. it was founded by the romans, who named it londinium. london's ancient core, the city of london, largely retains its 1.12-square-mile (2.9 km2) medieval boundaries. since at least the 19th century, london has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between middlesex, essex, surrey, kent, and hertfordshire, which today largely makes up greater london, a region governed by the mayor of london and the london assembly.
london is a leading global city in the arts, commerce, education, entertainment, fashion, finance, healthcare, media, professional services, research and development, tourism, and transportation. it is crowned as the world's largest financial centre and has the fifth- or sixth-largest metropolitan area gdp in the world. london is a world cultural capital. it is the world's most-visited city as measured by international arrivals and has the world's largest city airport system measured by passenger traffic. london is the world's leading investment destination, hosting more international retailers and ultra high-net-worth individuals than any other city. london's universities form the largest concentration of higher education institutes in europe. in 2012, london became the first city to have hosted the modern summer olympic games three times.
london has a diverse range of people and cultures, and more than 300 languages are spoken in the region. its estimated mid-2016 municipal population (corresponding to greater london) was 8,787,892, the largest of any city in the european union, and accounting for 13.4% of the uk population. london's urban area is the second most populous in the eu, after paris, with 9,787,426 inhabitants at the 2011 census. the city's metropolitan area is the most populous in the eu with 13,879,757 inhabitants, while the greater london authority states the population of the city-region (covering a large part of the south east) as 22.7 million. london was the world's most populous city from around 1831 to 1925.
london contains four world heritage sites: the tower of london; kew gardens; the site comprising the palace of westminster, westminster abbey, and st margaret's church; and the historic settlement of greenwich (in which the royal observatory, greenwich marks the prime meridian, 0° longitude, and gmt). other famous landmarks include buckingham palace, the london eye, piccadilly circus, st paul's cathedral, tower bridge, trafalgar square, and the shard. london is home to numerous museums, galleries, libraries, sporting events, and other cultural institutions, including the british museum, national gallery, natural history museum, tate modern, british library, and west end theatres.
the london underground is the oldest underground railway network in the world. etymology the etymology of london is uncertain. it is an ancient name, attested already in the first century ce, usually in the latinised form londinium; for example, hand-written roman tablets recovered in the city originating from ad 65/70-80 include the word londinio (in london).
over the years, the name has attracted many mythicising explanations. the earliest attested appears in geoffrey of monmouth's historia regum britanniae, written around 1136. this had it that the name originated from a supposed king lud, who had allegedly taken over the city and named it kaerlud.
modern scientific analyses of the name must account for the origins of the different forms found in early sources latin (usually londinium), old english (usually lunden), and welsh (usually llundein), with reference to the known developments over time of sounds in those different languages. it is agreed that the name came into these languages from british celtic; recent work tends to reconstruct the lost celtic form of the name as *[londonjon] or something similar. this was adapted into latin as londinium and borrowed into west germanic, the ancestor-language of english, already before english had become widely spoken in britain.
however, the etymology and original meaning of the british celtic form is much debated. a prominent explanation was richard coates's 1998 argument that the name derived from pre-celtic old european *(p)lowonida, meaning river too wide to ford. coates suggested that this was a name given to the part of the river thames which flows through london; from this, the settlement gained the celtic form of its name, *lowonidonjon. however, most work has accepted a celtic origin for the name, and recent studies have favoured an explanation along the lines of a celtic derivative of an proto-indo-european root *lendh- ('sink, cause to sink'), combined with the celtic suffix *-injo- or *-onjo- (used to form place-names). peter schrijver has specifically suggested, on these grounds, that the name originally meant 'place that floods (periodically, tidally)'.
until 1889, the name london officially applied only to the city of london, but since then it has also referred to the county of london and now to greater london.
london is sometimes abbreviated as l'don or ldn. history prehistory two recent discoveries indicate probable very early settlements near the thames in the london area. in 1999, the remains of a bronze age bridge were found on the foreshore north of vauxhall bridge. this bridge either crossed the thames, or gave access to a now lost island in the river. dendrochronology dated the timbers to ca. 1500 bc. in 2010 the foundations of a large timber structure, dated to ca. 4500 bc, were found on the thames foreshore, south of vauxhall bridge. the function of the mesolithic structure is not known. both structures are on the south bank, at a natural crossing point where the river effra flows into the river thames. roman london although there is evidence of scattered brythonic settlements in the area, the first major settlement was founded by the romans after the invasion of 43 ad. this lasted only until around 61, when the iceni tribe led by queen boudica stormed it, burning it to the ground. the next, heavily planned, incarnation of londinium prospered, and it superseded colchester as the capital of the roman province of britannia in 100. at its height in the 2nd century, roman london had a population of around 60,000. anglo-saxon london (and viking period) with the collapse of roman rule in the early 5th century, london ceased to be a capital, and the walled city of londinium was effectively abandoned, although roman civilisation continued in the st martin-in-the-fields area until around 450. from around 500, an anglo-saxon settlement known as lundenwic developed in the same area, slightly to the west of the old roman city. by about 680, it had revived sufficiently to become a major port, although there is little evidence of large-scale production of goods. from the 820s the town declined because of repeated viking invasions. there are three recorded viking assaults on london; two of these were successful, in 851 and 886, although the vikings were defeated during another attack in 994. the vikings established danelaw over much of the eastern and northern part of england, with its boundary roughly stretching from london to chester. it was an area of political and geographical control imposed by the viking incursions which was formally agreed by the danish warlord, guthrum and the west saxon king alfred the great in 886. the anglo-saxon chronicle recorded that alfred refounded london in 886. archaeological research shows that this involved abandonment of lundenwic and a revival of life and trade within the old roman walls. london then grew slowly until about 950, after which activity increased dramatically.
by the 11th century, london was beyond all comparison the largest town in england. westminster abbey, rebuilt in the romanesque style by king edward the confessor, was one of the grandest churches in europe. winchester had previously been the capital of anglo-saxon england, but from this time on, london became the main forum for foreign traders and the base for defence in time of war. in the view of frank stenton: it had the resources, and it was rapidly developing the dignity and the political self-consciousness appropriate to a national capital. middle ages after winning the battle of hastings, william, duke of normandy was crowned king of england in the newly completed westminster abbey on christmas day 1066. william constructed the tower of london, the first of the many norman castles in england to be rebuilt in stone, in the southeastern corner of the city, to intimidate the native inhabitants. in 1097, william ii began the building of westminster hall, close by the abbey of the same name. the hall became the basis of a new palace of westminster.
in the 12th century, the institutions of central government, which had hitherto accompanied the royal english court as it moved around the country, grew in size and sophistication and became increasingly fixed in one place. for most purposes this was westminster, although the royal treasury, having been moved from winchester, came to rest in the tower. while the city of westminster developed into a true capital in governmental terms, its distinct neighbour, the city of london, remained england's largest city and principal commercial centre, and it flourished under its own unique administration, the corporation of london. in 1100, its population was around 18,000; by 1300 it had grown to nearly 100,000. disaster struck in the form of the black death in the mid-14th century, when london lost nearly a third of its population. london was the focus of the peasants' revolt in 1381. early modern during the tudor period the reformation produced a gradual shift to protestantism, and much of london passed from church to private ownership. woollen cloth was shipped undyed and undressed from london to the nearby shores of the low countries, where it was considered indispensable. but the reach of english maritime enterprise hardly extended beyond the seas of north-west europe. the commercial route to italy and the mediterranean sea normally lay through antwerp and over the alps; any ships passing through the strait of gibraltar to or from england were likely to be italian or ragusan. upon the re-opening of the netherlands to english shipping in january 1565, there ensued a strong outburst of commercial activity. the royal exchange was founded. mercantilism grew, and monopoly trading companies such as the east india company were established, with trade expanding to the new world. london became the principal north sea port, with migrants arriving from england and abroad. the population rose from an estimated 50,000 in 1530 to about 225,000 in 1605.
in the 16th century william shakespeare and his contemporaries lived in london at a time of hostility to the development of the theatre. by the end of the tudor period in 1603, london was still very compact. there was an assassination attempt on james i in westminster, in the gunpowder plot on 5 november 1605. in the english civil war the majority of londoners supported the parliamentary cause. after an initial advance by the royalists in 1642, culminating in the battles of brentford and turnham green, london was surrounded by a defensive perimeter wall known as the lines of communication. the lines were built by up to 20,000 people, and were completed in under two months. the fortifications failed their only test when the new model army entered london in 1647, and they were levelled by parliament the same year.
london was plagued by disease in the early 17th century, culminating in the great plague of 1665–1666, which killed up to 100,000 people, or a fifth of the population. the great fire of london broke out in 1666 in pudding lane in the city and quickly swept through the wooden buildings. rebuilding took over ten years and was supervised by robert hooke as surveyor of london. in 1708 christopher wren's masterpiece, st paul's cathedral was completed. during the georgian era, new districts such as mayfair were formed in the west; new bridges over the thames encouraged development in south london. in the east, the port of london expanded downstream. london's development as an international financial centre matured for much of the 1700s.
in 1762, george iii acquired buckingham house and it was enlarged over the next 75 years. during the 18th century, london was dogged by crime, and the bow street runners were established in 1750 as a professional police force. in total, more than 200 offences were punishable by death, including petty theft. most children born in the city died before reaching their third birthday. the coffeehouse became a popular place to debate ideas, with growing literacy and the development of the printing press making news widely available; and fleet street became the centre of the british press. following the invasion of amsterdam by napoleonic armies, many financiers relocated to london, especially a large jewish community, and the first london international issue was arranged in 1817. around the same time, the royal navy became the world leading war fleet, acting as a serious deterrent to potential economic adversaries of the united kingdom. the repeal of the corn laws in 1846 was specifically aimed at weakening dutch economic power. london then overtook amsterdam as the leading international financial centre.
according to samuel johnson: you find no man, at all intellectual, who is willing to leave london. no, sir, when a man is tired of london, he is tired of life; for there is in london all that life can afford. late modern and contemporary london was the world's largest city from about 1831 to 1925. london's overcrowded conditions led to cholera epidemics, claiming 14,000 lives in 1848, and 6,000 in 1866. rising traffic congestion led to the creation of the world's first local urban rail network. the metropolitan board of works oversaw infrastructure expansion in the capital and some of the surrounding counties; it was abolished in 1889 when the london county council was created out of those areas of the counties surrounding the capital. london was bombed by the germans during the first world war, and during the second world war, the blitz and other bombings by the german luftwaffe killed over 30,000 londoners, destroying large tracts of housing and other buildings across the city. immediately after the war, the 1948 summer olympics were held at the original wembley stadium, at a time when london was still recovering from the war. from the 1940s onwards, london became home to a large number of immigrants, primarily from commonwealth countries such as jamaica, india, bangladesh and pakistan, making london one of the most diverse cities worldwide. in 1951, the festival of britain was held on the south bank. the great smog of 1952 led to the clean air act 1956, which ended the pea soup fogs for which london had been notorious.
primarily starting in the mid-1960s, london became a centre for the worldwide youth culture, exemplified by the swinging london subculture associated with the king's road, chelsea and carnaby street. the role of trendsetter was revived during the punk era. in 1965 london's political boundaries were expanded to take into account the growth of the urban area and a new greater london council was created. during the troubles in northern ireland, london was subjected to bombing attacks by the provisional ira. racial inequality was highlighted by the 1981 brixton riot.
greater london's population declined steadily in the decades after the second world war, from an estimated peak of 8.6 million in 1939 to around 6.8 million in the 1980s. the principal ports for london moved downstream to felixstowe and tilbury, with the london docklands area becoming a focus for regeneration, including the canary wharf development. this was borne out of london's ever-increasing role as a major international financial centre during the 1980s. the thames barrier was completed in the 1980s to protect london against tidal surges from the north sea. the greater london council was abolished in 1986, which left london without a central administration until 2000 when london-wide government was restored, with the creation of the greater london authority. to celebrate the start of the 21st century, the millennium dome, london eye and millennium bridge were constructed. on 6 july 2005 london was awarded the 2012 summer olympics, making london the first city to stage the olympic games three times. on 7 july 2005, three london underground trains and a double-decker bus were bombed in a series of terrorist attacks.
in 2008, london named alongside new york city and hong kong as nylonkong, being hailed as the world's three most influential global cities. in january 2015, greater london's population was estimated to be 8.63 million, the highest level since 1939. during the brexit referendum in 2016, the uk as a whole decided to leave the european union, but a majority of london constituencies voted to remain in the eu. administration local government the administration of london is formed of two tiers: a citywide, strategic tier and a local tier. citywide administration is coordinated by the greater london authority (gla), while local administration is carried out by 33 smaller authorities. the gla consists of two elected components: the mayor of london, who has executive powers, and the london assembly, which scrutinises the mayor's decisions and can accept or reject the mayor's budget proposals each year. the headquarters of the gla is city hall, southwark; the mayor is sadiq khan, the first muslim mayor of a major western capital. the mayor's statutory planning strategy is published as the london plan, which was most recently revised in 2011. the local authorities are the councils of the 32 london boroughs and the city of london corporation. they are responsible for most local services, such as local planning, schools, social services, local roads and refuse collection. certain functions, such as waste management, are provided through joint arrangements. in 2009–2010 the combined revenue expenditure by london councils and the gla amounted to just over £22 billion (£14.7 billion for the boroughs and £7.4 billion for the gla).
the london fire brigade is the statutory fire and rescue service for greater london. it is run by the london fire and emergency planning authority and is the third largest fire service in the world. national health service ambulance services are provided by the london ambulance service (las) nhs trust, the largest free-at-the-point-of-use emergency ambulance service in the world. the london air ambulance charity operates in conjunction with the las where required. her majesty's coastguard and the royal national lifeboat institution operate on the river thames, which is under the jurisdiction of the port of london authority from teddington lock to the sea. national government london is the seat of the government of the united kingdom. many government departments, as well as the prime minister's residence at 10 downing street, are based close to the palace of westminster, particularly along whitehall. the british parliament is often referred to as the mother of parliaments (although this sobriquet was first applied to england itself by john bright) because it has been the model for most other parliamentary systems. there are 73 members of parliament (mps) from london, elected from local parliamentary constituencies in the national parliament. as of may 2015, 45 are from the labour party, 27 are conservatives, and one is a liberal democrat. policing and crime policing in greater london, with the exception of the city of london, is provided by the metropolitan police service, overseen by the mayor through the mayor's office for policing and crime (mopac). the city of london has its own police force – the city of london police. the british transport police are responsible for police services on national rail, london underground, docklands light railway and tramlink services. a fourth police force in london, the ministry of defence police, do not generally become involved with policing the general public.
crime rates vary widely by area, ranging from parts with serious issues to parts considered very safe. today crime figures are made available nationally at local authority and ward level. in 2015 there were 118 homicides, a 25.5% increase over 2014. the metropolitan police have made detailed crime figures, broken down by category at borough and ward level, available on their website since 2000. geography scope london, also referred to as greater london, is one of nine regions of england and the top-level subdivision covering most of the city's metropolis. the small ancient city of london at its core once comprised the whole settlement, but as its urban area grew, the corporation of london resisted attempts to amalgamate the city with its suburbs, causing london to be defined in a number of ways for different purposes.
forty per cent of greater london is covered by the london post town, within which 'london' forms part of postal addresses. the london telephone area code (020) covers a larger area, similar in size to greater london, although some outer districts are excluded and some places just outside are included. the greater london boundary has been aligned to the m25 motorway in places.
outward urban expansion is now prevented by the metropolitan green belt, although the built-up area extends beyond the boundary in places, resulting in a separately defined greater london urban area. beyond this is the vast london commuter belt. greater london is split for some purposes into inner london and outer london. the city is split by the river thames into north and south, with an informal central london area in its interior. the coordinates of the nominal centre of london, traditionally considered to be the original eleanor cross at charing cross near the junction of trafalgar square and whitehall, are about 51°30′26″n 00°07′39″w. however the geographical centre of london, on one definition, is in the london borough of lambeth, just 0.1 miles to the northeast of lambeth north tube station. status within london, both the city of london and the city of westminster have city status and both the city of london and the remainder of greater london are counties for the purposes of lieutenancies. the area of greater london has incorporated areas that are part of the historic counties of middlesex, kent, surrey, essex and hertfordshire. london's status as the capital of england, and later the united kingdom, has never been granted or confirmed officially—by statute or in written form.
its position was formed through constitutional convention, making its status as de facto capital a part of the uk's unwritten constitution. the capital of england was moved to london from winchester as the palace of westminster developed in the 12th and 13th centuries to become the permanent location of the royal court, and thus the political capital of the nation. more recently, greater london has been defined as a region of england and in this context is known as london. topography greater london encompasses a total area of 1,583 square kilometres (611 sq mi), an area which had a population of 7,172,036 in 2001 and a population density of 4,542 inhabitants per square kilometre (11,760/sq mi). the extended area known as the london metropolitan region or the london metropolitan agglomeration, comprises a total area of 8,382 square kilometres (3,236 sq mi) has a population of 13,709,000 and a population density of 1,510 inhabitants per square kilometre (3,900/sq mi). modern london stands on the thames, its primary geographical feature, a navigable river which crosses the city from the south-west to the east. the thames valley is a floodplain surrounded by gently rolling hills including parliament hill, addington hills, and primrose hill. historically london grew up at the lowest bridging point on the thames. the thames was once a much broader, shallower river with extensive marshlands; at high tide, its shores reached five times their present width.
since the victorian era the thames has been extensively embanked, and many of its london tributaries now flow underground. the thames is a tidal river, and london is vulnerable to flooding. the threat has increased over time because of a slow but continuous rise in high water level by the slow 'tilting' of britain (up in the north and down in the south) caused by post-glacial rebound.
in 1974, a decade of work began on the construction of the thames barrier across the thames at woolwich to deal with this threat. while the barrier is expected to function as designed until roughly 2070, concepts for its future enlargement or redesign are already being discussed. climate london has a temperate oceanic climate (köppen: cfb ), similar to all of southern england. despite its reputation as being a rainy city, london receives less precipitation in a year than rome, bordeaux, toulouse, naples, sydney and new york. temperature extremes for all sites in the london area range from 38.1 °c (100.6 °f) at kew during august 2003 down to −16.1 °c (3.0 °f) at northolt during january 1962.
summers are mild, but generally warm. london's average july high is 24 °c (74°f). on average london will see 31 days above 25 °c (77.0 °f) each year, and 4.2 days above 30.0 °c (86.0 °f) every year. during the 2003 european heat wave there were 14 consecutive days above 30 °c (86.0 °f) and 2 consecutive days where temperatures reached 38 °c (100.4 °f), leading to hundreds of heat related deaths.
winters are generally cool, cloudy and damp with little temperature variation. snowfall occurs occasionally and can cause travel disruption when this happens. snowfall is more common in outer london. spring and autumn are mixed seasons and can be pleasant. as a large city, london has a considerable urban heat island effect, making the centre of london at times 5 °c (9 °f) warmer than the suburbs and outskirts. the effect of this can be seen below when comparing london heathrow, 15 miles west of london, with the london weather centre, in the city centre. districts london's vast urban area is often described using a set of district names, such as bloomsbury, mayfair, wembley and whitechapel. these are either informal designations, reflect the names of villages that have been absorbed by sprawl, or are superseded administrative units such as parishes or former boroughs.
such names have remained in use through tradition, each referring to a local area with its own distinctive character, but without official boundaries. since 1965 greater london has been divided into 32 london boroughs in addition to the ancient city of london. the city of london is the main financial district, and canary wharf has recently developed into a new financial and commercial hub in the docklands to the east.
the west end is london's main entertainment and shopping district, attracting tourists. west london includes expensive residential areas where properties can sell for tens of millions of pounds. the average price for properties in kensington and chelsea is over £2 million with a similarly high outlay in most of central london.
the east end is the area closest to the original port of london, known for its high immigrant population, as well as for being one of the poorest areas in london. the surrounding east london area saw much of london's early industrial development; now, brownfield sites throughout the area are being redeveloped as part of the thames gateway including the london riverside and lower lea valley, which was developed into the olympic park for the 2012 olympics and paralympics. architecture london's buildings are too diverse to be characterised by any particular architectural style, partly because of their varying ages. many grand houses and public buildings, such as the national gallery, are constructed from portland stone. some areas of the city, particularly those just west of the centre, are characterised by white stucco or whitewashed buildings. few structures in central london pre-date the great fire of 1666, these being a few trace roman remains, the tower of london and a few scattered tudor survivors in the city. further out is, for example, the tudor-period hampton court palace, england's oldest surviving tudor palace, built by cardinal thomas wolsey c.1515.
wren's late 17th-century churches and the financial institutions of the 18th and 19th centuries such as the royal exchange and the bank of england, to the early 20th century old bailey and the 1960s barbican estate form part of the varied architectural heritage. the disused – but soon to be rejuvenated – 1939 battersea power station by the river in the south-west is a local landmark, while some railway termini are excellent examples of victorian architecture, most notably st. pancras and paddington. the density of london varies, with high employment density in the central area, high residential densities in inner london, and lower densities in outer london.
the monument in the city of london provides views of the surrounding area while commemorating the great fire of london, which originated nearby. marble arch and wellington arch, at the north and south ends of park lane, respectively, have royal connections, as do the albert memorial and royal albert hall in kensington. nelson's column is a nationally recognised monument in trafalgar square, one of the focal points of central london. older buildings are mainly brick built, most commonly the yellow london stock brick or a warm orange-red variety, often decorated with carvings and white plaster mouldings.
in the dense areas, most of the concentration is via medium- and high-rise buildings. london's skyscrapers, such as 30 st mary axe, tower 42, the broadgate tower and one canada square, are mostly in the two financial districts, the city of london and canary wharf. high-rise development is restricted at certain sites if it would obstruct protected views of st paul's cathedral and other historic buildings. nevertheless, there are a number of very tall skyscrapers in central london (see tall buildings in london), including the 95-storey shard london bridge, the tallest building in the european union.
other notable modern buildings include city hall in southwark with its distinctive oval shape and the british library in somers town/kings cross. what was formerly the millennium dome, by the thames to the east of canary wharf, is now an entertainment venue called the o2 arena. natural history the london natural history society suggest that london is one of the world's greenest cities with more than 40 percent green space or open water. they indicate that 2000 species of flowering plant have been found growing there and that the tidal thames supports 120 species of fish. they also state that over 60 species of bird nest in central london and that their members have recorded 47 species of butterfly, 1173 moths and more than 270 kinds of spider around london. london's wetland areas support nationally important populations of many water birds. london has 38 sites of special scientific interest (sssis), two national nature reserves and 76 local nature reserves.
amphibians are common in the capital, including smooth newts living by the tate modern, and common frogs, common toads, palmate newts and great crested newts. on the other hand, native reptiles such as slowworms, common lizards, grass snakes and adders, are mostly only seen in outer london. among other inhabitants of london are 10,000 foxes, so that there are now 16 foxes for every square mile (2.6 square kilometres) of london. these urban foxes are noticeably bolder than their country cousins, sharing the pavement with pedestrians and raising cubs in people's backyards. foxes have even sneaked into the houses of parliament, where one was found asleep on a filing cabinet. another broke into the grounds of buckingham palace, reportedly killing some of queen elizabeth ii's prized pink flamingos. generally, however, foxes and city folk appear to get along. a survey in 2001 by the london-based mammal society found that 80 percent of 3,779 respondents who volunteered to keep a diary of garden mammal visits liked having them around. this sample cannot be taken to represent londoners as a whole.
other mammals found in greater london are hedgehogs, rats, mice, rabbit, shrew, vole, and squirrels, in wilder areas of outer london, such as epping forest, a wide variety of mammals are found including hare, badger, field, bank and water vole, wood mouse, yellow-necked mouse, mole, shrew, and weasel, in addition to fox, squirrel and hedgehog. a dead otter was found at the highway, in wapping, about a mile from the tower bridge, which would suggest that they have begun to move back after being absent a hundred years from the city. ten of england's eighteen species of bats have been recorded in epping forest: soprano, nathusius and common pipistrelles, noctule, serotine, barbastelle, daubenton's, brown long-eared, natterer's and leisler's.
among the strange sights seen in london have been a whale in the thames, while the bbc two programme natural world: unnatural history of london shows pigeons using the london underground to get around the city, a seal that takes fish from fishmongers outside billingsgate fish market, and foxes that will sit if given sausages.
herds of red and fallow deer also roam freely within much of richmond and bushy park. a cull takes place each november and february to ensure numbers can be sustained. epping forest is also known for its fallow deer, which can frequently be seen in herds to the north of the forest. a rare population of melanistic, black fallow deer is also maintained at the deer sanctuary near theydon bois. muntjac deer, which escaped from deer parks at the turn of the twentieth century, are also found in the forest. while londoners are accustomed to wildlife such as birds and foxes sharing the city, more recently urban deer have started becoming a regular feature, and whole herds of fallow and white-tailed deer come into residential areas at night to take advantage of london's green spaces. demography the 2011 census recorded that 2,998,264 people or 36.7% of london's population are foreign-born making london the city with the second largest immigrant population, behind new york city, in terms of absolute numbers. about 69% of children born in london in 2015 had at least one parent who was born abroad. the table to the right shows the most common countries of birth of london residents. note that some of the german-born population, in 18th position, are british citizens from birth born to parents serving in the british armed forces in germany.
with increasing industrialisation, london's population grew rapidly throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, and it was for some time in the late 19th and early 20th centuries the most populous city in the world. its population peaked at 8,615,245 in 1939 immediately before the outbreak of the second world war, but had declined to 7,192,091 at the 2001 census. however, the population then grew by just over a million between the 2001 and 2011 censuses, to reach 8,173,941 in the latter enumeration.
however, london's continuous urban area extends beyond the borders of greater london and was home to 9,787,426 people in 2011, while its wider metropolitan area has a population of between 12 and 14 million depending on the definition used. according to eurostat, london is the most populous city and metropolitan area of the european union and the second most populous in europe. during the period 1991–2001 a net 726,000 immigrants arrived in london.
the region covers an area of 1,579 square kilometres (610 sq mi). the population density is 5,177 inhabitants per square kilometre (13,410/sq mi), more than ten times that of any other british region. in terms of population, london is the 19th largest city and the 18th largest metropolitan region in the world. as of 2014, london has the largest number of billionaires (british pound sterling) in the world, with 72 residing in the city. london ranks as one of the most expensive cities in the world, alongside tokyo and moscow. ethnic groups according to the office for national statistics, based on the 2011 census estimates, 59.8 per cent of the 8,173,941 inhabitants of london were white, with 44.9 per cent white british, 2.2 per cent white irish, 0.1 per cent gypsy/irish traveller and 12.1 per cent classified as other white.
20.9 per cent of londoners are of asian and mixed-asian descent. 19.7 per cent are of full asian descent, with those of mixed-asian heritage comprising 1.2 of the population. indians account for 6.6 per cent of the population, followed by pakistanis and bangladeshis at 2.7 per cent each. chinese peoples account for 1.5 per cent of the population, with arabs comprising 1.3 per cent. a further 4.9 per cent are classified as other asian.
15.6 per cent of london's population are of black and mixed-black descent. 13.3 per cent are of full black descent, with those of mixed-black heritage comprising 2.3 per cent. black africans account for 7.0 per cent of london's population, with 4.2 per cent as black caribbean and 2.1 per cent as other black. 5.0 per cent are of mixed race.
across london, black and asian children outnumber white british children by about six to four in state schools. altogether at the 2011 census, of london's 1,624,768 population aged 0 to 15, 46.4 per cent were white, 19.8 per cent were asian, 19 per cent were black, 10.8 per cent were mixed and 4 per cent represented another ethnic group. in january 2005, a survey of london's ethnic and religious diversity claimed that there were more than 300 languages spoken in london and more than 50 non-indigenous communities with a population of more than 10,000. figures from the office for national statistics show that, in 2010, london's foreign-born population was 2,650,000 (33 per cent), up from 1,630,000 in 1997.
the 2011 census showed that 36.7 per cent of greater london's population were born outside the uk. a portion of the german-born population are likely to be british nationals born to parents serving in the british armed forces in germany. estimates produced by the office for national statistics indicate that the five largest foreign-born groups living in london in the period july 2009 to june 2010 were those born in india, poland, the republic of ireland, bangladesh and nigeria. religion according to the 2011 census, the largest religious groupings are christians (48.4 per cent), followed by those of no religion (20.7 per cent), muslims (12.4 per cent), no response (8.5 per cent), hindus (5.0 per cent), jews (1.8 per cent), sikhs (1.5 per cent), buddhists (1.0 per cent) and other (0.6 per cent).
london has traditionally been christian, and has a large number of churches, particularly in the city of london. the well-known st paul's cathedral in the city and southwark cathedral south of the river are anglican administrative centres, while the archbishop of canterbury, principal bishop of the church of england and worldwide anglican communion, has his main residence at lambeth palace in the london borough of lambeth. important national and royal ceremonies are shared between st paul's and westminster abbey. the abbey is not to be confused with nearby westminster cathedral, which is the largest roman catholic cathedral in england and wales. despite the prevalence of anglican churches, observance is very low within the anglican denomination. church attendance continues on a long, slow, steady decline, according to church of england statistics.
london is also home to sizeable muslim, hindu, sikh, and jewish communities. notable mosques include the east london mosque in tower hamlets, london central mosque on the edge of regent's park and the baitul futuh mosque of the ahmadiyya muslim community. following the oil boom, increasing numbers of wealthy hindus and middle-eastern muslims have based themselves around mayfair and knightsbridge in west london. there are large muslim communities in the eastern boroughs of tower hamlets and newham. large hindu communities are in the north-western boroughs of harrow and brent, the latter of which is home to europe's largest hindu temple, neasden temple. london is also home to 42 hindu temples. there are sikh communities in east and west london, particularly in southall, home to one of the largest sikh populations and the largest sikh temple outside india.
the majority of british jews live in london, with significant jewish communities in stamford hill, stanmore, golders green, finchley, hampstead, hendon and edgware in north london. bevis marks synagogue in the city of london is affiliated to london's historic sephardic jewish community. it is the only synagogue in europe which has held regular services continuously for over 300 years. stanmore and canons park synagogue has the largest membership of any single orthodox synagogue in the whole of europe, overtaking ilford synagogue (also in london) in 1998. the community set up the london jewish forum in 2006 in response to the growing significance of devolved london government. accent there are many accents that are traditionally thought of as london accents. the most well known of the london accents long ago acquired the cockney label, which is heard both in london itself, and across the wider south east england region more generally. the accent of a 21st-century londoner varies widely; what is becoming more and more common amongst the under-30s however is some fusion of cockney with a whole array of ethnic accents, in particular caribbean, which form an accent labelled multicultural london english (mle). the other widely heard and spoken accent is rp (received pronunciation) in various forms, which can often be heard in the media and many of other traditional professions and beyond, although this accent is not limited to london and south east england, and can also be heard selectively throughout the whole uk amongst certain social groupings. economy london generates about 20 per cent of the uk's gdp (or $600 billion in 2014); while the economy of the london metropolitan area—the largest in europe—generates about 30 per cent of the uk's gdp (or an estimated $669 billion in 2005). london has five major business districts: the city, westminster, canary wharf, camden & islington and lambeth & southwark. one way to get an idea of their relative importance is to look at relative amounts of office space: greater london had 27 million m2 of office space in 2001, and the city contains the most space, with 8 million m2 of office space. london has some of the highest real estate prices in the world. london is the world's most expensive office market for the last three years according to world property journal (2015) report. as of 2015 the residential property in london is worth $2.2 trillion – same value as that of brazil annual gdp. the city has the highest property prices of any european city according to the office for national statistics and the european office of statistics. on average the price per square metre in central london is €24,252 (april 2014). this is higher than the property prices in other g8 european capital cities; berlin €3,306, rome €6,188 and paris €11,229. the city of london london finance industry is based in the city of london and canary wharf, the two major central business districts in london. london is one of the pre-eminent financial centres of the world as the most important location for international finance. london took over as a major financial centre shortly after 1795 when the dutch republic collapsed before the napoleonic armies. for many bankers established in amsterdam (e.g. hope, baring), this was only time to move to london. the london financial elite was strengthened by a strong jewish community from all over europe capable of mastering the most sophisticated financial tools of the time. this unique concentration of talents accelerated the transition from the commercial revolution to the industrial revolution. by the end of the 19th century, britain was the wealthiest of all nations, and london a leading financial centre. still, as of 2016 london tops the world rankings on both the global financial centres index (gfci) and the global cities index.
london's largest industry is finance, and its financial exports make it a large contributor to the uk's balance of payments. around 325,000 people were employed in financial services in london until mid-2007. london has over 480 overseas banks, more than any other city in the world. it is also the world's biggest currency trading centre, accounting for some 37 percent of the $5.1 trillion average daily volume, according to the bis. over 85 percent (3.2 million) of the employed population of greater london works in the services industries. because of its prominent global role, london's economy had been affected by the financial crisis of 2007–2008. however, by 2010 the city has recovered; put in place new regulatory powers, proceeded to regain lost ground and re-established london's economic dominance. along with professional services headquarters, the city of london is home to the bank of england, london stock exchange, and lloyd's of london insurance market.
over half of the uk's top 100 listed companies (the ftse 100) and over 100 of europe's 500 largest companies have their headquarters in central london. over 70 per cent of the ftse 100 are within london's metropolitan area, and 75 per cent of fortune 500 companies have offices in london. media and technology media companies are concentrated in london and the media distribution industry is london's second most competitive sector. the bbc is a significant employer, while other broadcasters also have headquarters around the city. many national newspapers are edited in london. london is a major retail centre and in 2010 had the highest non-food retail sales of any city in the world, with a total spend of around £64.2 billion. the port of london is the second-largest in the united kingdom, handling 45 million tonnes of cargo each year.
a growing number of technology companies are based in london notably in east london tech city, also known as silicon roundabout. in april 2014, the city was among the first to receive a geotld. in february 2014 london was ranked as the european city of the future in the 2014/15 list by fdi magazine.
the gas and electricity distribution networks that manage and operate the towers, cables and pressure systems that deliver energy to consumers across the city are managed by national grid plc, sgn and uk power networks. tourism london is one of the leading tourist destinations in the world and in 2015 was ranked as the most visited city in the world with over 65 million visits. it is also the top city in the world by visitor cross-border spending, estimated at us$20.23 billion in 2015. tourism is one of london's prime industries, employing the equivalent of 350,000 full-time workers in 2003, and the city accounts for 54% of all inbound visitor spending in the uk. as of 2016 london is the world top city destination as ranked by tripadvisor users.
in 2015, the top most-visited attractions in uk were all in london. the top 10 most visited attractions were: (with visits per venue) the british museum: 6,820,686
the national gallery: 5,908,254
natural history museum (south kensington): 5,284,023
southbank centre: 5,102,883
tate modern: 4,712,581
victoria and albert museum (south kensington): 3,432,325
science museum: 3,356,212
somerset house: 3,235,104

national portrait gallery: 2,145,486
the number of hotel rooms in london in 2015 stood at 138,769, and is expected to grow over the years. housing crisis thousands of homeless families find themselves in emergency accommodation for at least two years. a growth in the number of uk households has led to the homeless charity shelter stating: this growth is a result of people living longer, more people living alone or in smaller households, and net migration. transport transport is one of the four main areas of policy administered by the mayor of london, however the mayor's financial control does not extend to the longer distance rail network that enters london. in 2007 he assumed responsibility for some local lines, which now form the london overground network, adding to the existing responsibility for the london underground, trams and buses. the public transport network is administered by transport for london (tfl).
the lines that formed the london underground, as well as trams and buses, became part of an integrated transport system in 1933 when the london passenger transport board or london transport was created. transport for london is now the statutory corporation responsible for most aspects of the transport system in greater london, and is run by a board and a commissioner appointed by the mayor of london. aviation london is a major international air transport hub with the busiest city airspace in the world. eight airports use the word london in their name, but most traffic passes through six of these. additionally, various other airports also serve london, catering primarily to general aviation flights.
london heathrow airport, in hillingdon, west london, is the busiest airport in the world for international traffic, and is the major hub of the nation's flag carrier, british airways. in march 2008 its fifth terminal was opened. there were plans for a third runway and a sixth terminal; however, these were cancelled by the coalition government on 12 may 2010.
gatwick airport, south of london in west sussex, handles similar traffic, with some cheap short-haul flights.
stansted airport, north east of london in essex, is a local uk hub.
luton airport to the north of london in bedfordshire, caters mostly for cheap short-haul flights.
london city airport, the smallest and most central airport, in newham, east london, is focused on business travellers, with a mixture of full service short-haul scheduled flights and considerable business jet traffic.
london southend airport, east of london in essex, is a smaller, regional airport that mainly caters for cheap short-haul flights. rail underground and dlr the london underground, commonly referred to as the tube, is the oldest and second longest metro system in the world. the system serves 270 stations and was formed from several private companies, including the world's first underground electric line, the city and south london railway. it dates from 1863.
over four million journeys are made every day on the underground network, over 1 billion each year. an investment programme is attempting to reduce congestion and improve reliability, including £6.5 billion (€7.7 billion) spent before the 2012 summer olympics. the docklands light railway (dlr), which opened in 1987, is a second, more local metro system using smaller and lighter tram-type vehicles that serve the docklands, greenwich and lewisham. suburban there are 366 railway stations in the london travelcard zones on an extensive above-ground suburban railway network. south london, particularly, has a high concentration of railways as it has fewer underground lines. most rail lines terminate around the centre of london, running into eighteen terminal stations, with the exception of the thameslink trains connecting bedford in the north and brighton in the south via luton and gatwick airports. london has britain's busiest station by number of passengers – waterloo, with over 184 million people using the interchange station complex (which includes waterloo east station) each year. clapham junction is the busiest station in europe by the number of trains passing.
with the need for more rail capacity in london, crossrail is due to open in 2018. it will be a new railway line running east to west through london and into the home counties with a branch to heathrow airport. it is europe's biggest construction project, with a £15 billion projected cost. inter-city and international london is the centre of the national rail network, with 70 percent of rail journeys starting or ending in london. like suburban rail services, regional and inter-city trains depart from several termini around the city centre, linking london with the rest of britain including birmingham, brighton, reading, bristol, cardiff, derby, exeter, sheffield, southampton, leeds, liverpool, manchester, cambridge, newcastle-upon-tyne, edinburgh and glasgow.
some international railway services to continental europe were operated during the 20th century as boat trains, such as the admiraal de ruijter to amsterdam and the night ferry to paris and brussels. the opening of the channel tunnel in 1994 connected london directly to the continental rail network, allowing eurostar services to begin. since 2007, high-speed trains link st. pancras international with lille, paris, brussels and european tourist destinations via the high speed 1 rail link and the channel tunnel. the first high-speed domestic trains started in june 2009 linking kent to london. there are plans for a second high speed line linking london to the midlands, north west england, and yorkshire. freight although rail freight levels are far down compared to their height, significant quantities of cargo are also carried into and out of london by rail; chiefly building materials and landfill waste. as a major hub of the british railway network, london's tracks also carry large amounts of freight for the other regions, such as container freight from the channel tunnel and english channel ports, and nuclear waste for reprocessing at sellafield. buses and trams london's bus network is one of the largest in the world, running 24 hours a day, with about 8,500 buses, more than 700 bus routes and around 19,500 bus stops. in 2013, the network had more than 2 billion commuter trips per annum, more than the underground. around £850 million is taken in revenue each year. london has the largest wheelchair accessible network in the world and, from the 3rd quarter of 2007, became more accessible to hearing and visually impaired passengers as audio-visual announcements were introduced. the distinctive red double-decker buses are an internationally recognised trademark of london transport along with black cabs and the tube.
london has a modern tram network, known as tramlink, centred on croydon in south london. the network has 39 stops and four routes, and carried 28 million people in 2013. since june 2008 transport for london has completely owned tramlink, and it plans to spend £54m by 2015 on maintenance, renewals, upgrades and capacity enhancements. cable car london's first and only cable car, known as the emirates air line, opened in june 2012. crossing the river thames, linking greenwich peninsula and the royal docks in the east of the city, the cable car is integrated with london's oyster card ticketing system, although special fares are charged. costing £60 million to build, it carries over 3,500 passengers every day, although this is very much lower than its capacity. similar to the santander cycles bike hire scheme, the cable car is sponsored in a 10-year deal by the airline emirates. cycling cycling is an increasingly popular way to get around london. the launch of a cycle hire scheme in july 2010 has been successful and generally well received. the london cycling campaign lobbies for better provision. but in the central parts (the city & city of westminster) are common cyclists a rare thing to see. only messenger with helmets and sport bikes are seen there. there is a general lack of bike roads. further out from the city centre is however lots of bikes parked around tube stations and other. port and river boats from being the largest port in the world, the port of london is now only the second-largest in the united kingdom, handling 45 million tonnes of cargo each year. most of this actually passes through the port of tilbury, outside the boundary of greater london.
london has frequent river boat services on the thames known as thames clippers. these run up to every 20 minutes between embankment pier and north greenwich pier. the woolwich ferry, with 2.5 million passengers every year, is a frequent service linking the north and south circular roads. other operators run both commuter and tourist boat services in london. roads although the majority of journeys involving central london are made by public transport, car travel is common in the suburbs. the inner ring road (around the city centre), the north and south circular roads (in the suburbs), and the outer orbital motorway (the m25, outside the built-up area) encircle the city and are intersected by a number of busy radial routes—but very few motorways penetrate into inner london. a plan for a comprehensive network of motorways throughout the city (the ringways plan) was prepared in the 1960s but was mostly cancelled in the early 1970s. the m25 is the longest ring-road motorway in the world at 121.5 mi (195.5 km) long. the a1 and m1 connect london to leeds, and newcastle and edinburgh.
london is notorious for its traffic congestion, with the m25 motorway the busiest stretch in the country. the average speed of a car in the rush hour is 10.6 mph (17.1 km/h).
in 2003, a congestion charge was introduced to reduce traffic volumes in the city centre. with a few exceptions, motorists are required to pay £10 per day to drive within a defined zone encompassing much of central london. motorists who are residents of the defined zone can buy a greatly reduced season pass. london government initially expected the congestion charge zone to increase daily peak period underground and bus users by 20,000 people, reduce road traffic by 10 to 15 per cent, increase traffic speeds by 10 to 15 per cent, and reduce queues by 20 to 30 per cent. over the course of several years, the average number of cars entering the centre of london on a weekday was reduced from 195,000 to 125,000 cars – a 35-per-cent reduction of vehicles driven per day. education tertiary education london is a major global centre of higher education teaching and research and has the largest concentration of higher education institutes in europe. according to the qs world university rankings 2015/16, london has the greatest concentration of top class universities in the world and its international student population of around 110,000 is larger than any other city in the world. a 2014 pricewaterhousecoopers report termed london as the global capital of higher education.

lisbon (; portuguese: lisboa, ipa: [liʒˈboɐ]) is the capital and the largest city of portugal, with a population of 552,700 within its administrative limits in an area of 100.05 km2. its urban area extends beyond the city's administrative limits with a population of around 3 million people, being the 11th-most populous urban area in the european union. about 3 million people live in the lisbon metropolitan area (which represents approximately 27% of the country's population). it is continental europe's westernmost capital city and the only one along the atlantic coast. lisbon lies in the western iberian peninsula on the atlantic ocean and the river tagus. the westernmost areas of its metro area is the westernmost point of continental europe.
lisbon is recognised as a alpha- level global city by the globalization and world cities (gawc) study group because of its importance in finance, commerce, media, entertainment, arts, international trade, education and tourism. lisbon is the only portuguese city besides porto to be recognised as a global city. it is one of the major economic centres on the continent, with a growing financial sector and one of the largest container ports on europe's atlantic coast. humberto delgado airport serves over 20 million passengers annually, as of 2015, and the motorway network and the high-speed rail system of alfa pendular link the main cities of portugal. the city is the 7th-most-visited city in southern europe, after rome, barcelona, madrid, athens and milan, with 1,740,000 tourists in 2009. the lisbon region contributes with a higher gdp ppp per capita than any other region in portugal. its gdp amounts to 96.3 billion usd and thus $32,434 per capita .the city occupies 32nd place of highest gross earnings in the world. most of the headquarters of multinationals in the country are located in the lisbon area. it is also the political centre of the country, as its seat of government and residence of the head of state.
lisbon is one of the oldest cities in the world, and the oldest in western europe, predating other modern european capitals such as london, paris and rome by centuries. julius caesar made it a municipium called felicitas julia, adding to the name olissipo. ruled by a series of germanic tribes from the 5th century, it was captured by the moors in the 8th century. in 1147, the crusaders under afonso henriques reconquered the city and since then it has been a major political, economic and cultural centre of portugal. unlike most capital cities, lisbon's status as the capital of portugal has never been granted or confirmed officially – by statute or in written form. its position as the capital has formed through constitutional convention, making its position as de facto capital a part of the constitution of portugal.
lisbon enjoys a mediterranean climate. it has one of the warmest winters of any metropolis in europe, with average temperatures 15 °c (59 °f) during the day and 8 °c (46 °f) at night from december to february. the typical summer season lasts about four months, from june to september, although also in april temperatures sometimes reach around 25 °c (77.0 °f). etymology one claim often repeated in non-academic literature is that the name of lisbon can be traced back to phoenician times, usually referring to the supposed phoenician term alis-ubo, meaning safe harbour,. lisbon's origin may in fact derive from proto-celtic or celtic olisippo, lissoppo or a similar name which other visiting peoples like the ancient phoenicians, greeks and romans adapted accordingly. roman authors of the first century ad referred to popular legends that the city of lisbon was founded by the mythical hero odysseus on his journey home from troy. although modern archaeological excavations show a phoenician presence at this location since 1200 bc, neither of these folk etymologies has any historical credibility. another conjecture based on ancient hydronymy suggests that the name of the settlement derived from the pre-roman appellation for the tagus river, lisso or lucio. lisbon's name was written ulyssippo in latin by the geographer pomponius mela, a native of hispania. it was later referred to as olisippo by pliny the elder and by the greeks as olissipo (Ὀλισσιπών) or olissipona (Ὀλισσιπόνα). history pre-roman during the neolithic period, the region was inhabited by pre-celtic tribes, who built religious and funerary monuments, megaliths, dolmens and menhirs, which still survive in areas on the periphery of lisbon. the indo-european celts invaded in the 1st millennium bc, mixing with the pre-indo-european population, thus giving rise to celtic-speaking local tribes such as the cempsi.
although the first fortifications on lisbon's castelo hill are known to be no older than the 2nd century bc, recent archaeological finds have shown that iron age people occupied the site from the 8th to 6th centuries bc. this indigenous settlement maintained commercial relations with the phoenicians, which would account for the recent findings of phoenician pottery and other material objects. archaeological excavations made near the castle of são jorge (castelo de são jorge) and lisbon cathedral indicate a phoenician presence at this location since 1200 bc, and it can be stated with confidence that a phoenician trading post stood on a site now the centre of the present city, on the southern slope of the castle hill. the sheltered harbour in the tagus river estuary was an ideal spot for an iberian settlement and would have provided a secure harbour for unloading and provisioning phoenician ships. the tagus settlement was an important centre of commercial trade with the inland tribes, providing an outlet for the valuable metals, salt and salted-fish they collected, and for the sale of the lusitanian horses renowned in antiquity.
according to legend, the location was named for the mythical ulysses, who founded the settlement after he left troy to escape the greek coalition. later, the greek name appeared in vulgar latin in the form olissipona. roman era following the defeat of hannibal during the punic wars, the romans determined to deprive carthage of its most valuable possession: hispania (the iberian peninsula). the defeat of carthaginian forces by scipio africanus in eastern hispania allowed the pacification of the west, led by consul decimus junius brutus callaicus. decimus obtained the alliance of olissipo (which sent men to fight alongside the roman legions against the northwestern celtic tribes) by integrating it into the empire, as the municipium cives romanorum felicitas julia. local authorities were granted self-rule over a territory that extended 50 kilometres (31 miles); exempt from taxes, its citizens were given the privileges of roman citizenship, and it was then integrated with the roman province of lusitania (whose capital was emerita augusta).
lusitanian raids and rebellions during roman occupation required the construction of a wall around the settlement. during augustus' reign, the romans also built a great theatre; the cassian baths (underneath rua da prata); temples to jupiter, diana, cybele, tethys and idea phrygiae (an uncommon cult from asia minor), in addition to temples to the emperor; a large necropolis under praça da figueira; a large forum and other buildings such as insulae (multi-storied apartment buildings) in the area between the castle hill and the historic city core. many of these ruins were first unearthed during the mid-18th century (when the recent discovery of pompeii made roman archaeology fashionable among europe's upper classes).
the city prospered as piracy was eliminated and technological advances were introduced, consequently felicitas julia became a centre of trade with the roman provinces of britannia (particularly cornwall) and the rhine. economically strong, olissipo was known for its garum (a fish sauce highly prized by the elites of the empire and exported in amphorae to rome), wine, salt and horse-breeding, while roman culture permeated the hinterland. the city was connected by a broad road to western hispania's two other large cities, bracara augusta in the province of tarraconensis (portuguese braga), and emerita augusta, the capital of lusitania (mérida, spain). the city was ruled by an oligarchical council dominated by two families, the julii and the cassiae, although regional authority was administered by the roman governor of emerita or directly by emperor tiberius. among the majority of latin speakers lived a large minority of greek traders and slaves.
around 80 bc, the roman quintus sertorius led a rebellion against the dictator sulla. during this period, he organised the tribes of lusitania and hispania and was on the verge of forming an independent province in the sertorian war when he was assassinated.
olissipo, like most great cities in the western empire, was a centre for the dissemination of christianity. its first attested bishop was potamius (c. 356), and there were several martyrs during the period of persecution of the christians: maxima, verissimus and eulalia of mérida are the most significant examples. by the time of the fall of rome, olissipo had become a notable christian centre.
following the disintegration of the roman empire there were barbarian invasions; between 409 and 429 the city was occupied successively by sarmatians, alans and vandals. the germanic suebi, who established a kingdom in gallaecia (modern galicia and northern portugal), with its capital in bracara augusta, also controlled the region of lisbon until 585. in 585, the suebi kingdom was integrated into the germanic visigothic kingdom of toledo, which comprised all of the iberian peninsula: lisbon was then called ulishbona. middle ages on 6 august 711, lisbon was taken by muslim forces. these conquerors, who were mostly berbers and arabs from north africa and the middle east, built many mosques and houses, rebuilt the city wall (known as the cerca moura) and established administrative control, while permitting the diverse population (muladi, mozarabs, berbers, arabs, jews, zanj and saqaliba) to maintain their socio-cultural lifestyles. mozarabic was the native language spoken by most of the christian population although arabic was widely known as spoken by all religious communities. islam was the official religion practised by the arabs, berbers, zanj, saqaliba and muladi (muwalladun). the muslim influence is still visible present in the alfama district, an old quarter of lisbon that survived the 1755 lisbon earthquake: many place-names are derived from arabic and the alfama (the oldest existing district of lisbon) was derived from the arabic al-hamma.
for a brief time, lisbon was an independent muslim kingdom known as the taifa of lisbon, before being conquered by the larger taifa of badajoz in 1094.
in 1108 lisbon was raided and occupied by norwegian crusaders led by sigurd i on their way to the holy land as part of the norwegian crusade and occupied by crusader forces for three years. it was taken by the moorish almoravids in 1111. in 1147, as part of the reconquista, crusader knights led by afonso i of portugal besieged and conquered lisbon. the city, with around 154,000 residents at the time, was returned to christian rule. the reconquest of portugal and re-establishment of christianity is one of the most significant events in lisbon's history, described in the chronicle expugnatione lyxbonensi, which describes, among other incidents, how the local bishop was killed by the crusaders and the city's residents prayed to the virgin mary as it happened. some of the muslim residents converted to roman catholicism, and most of those who did not convert fled to other parts of the islamic world, primarily muslim spain and north africa. all mosques were either completely destroyed or converted into churches. as a result of the end of muslim rule, spoken arabic quickly lost its place in the everyday life of the city and disappeared altogether.
with its central location, lisbon became the capital city of the new portuguese territory in 1255. the first portuguese university was founded in lisbon in 1290 by king denis i; for many years the studium generale (general study) was transferred intermittently to coimbra, where it was installed permanently in the 16th century as the university of coimbra.
in 1384, the city was besieged by king juan i of castille, as a part of the ongoing 1383–1385 crisis. the result of the siege was a victory for the portuguese led by nuno Álvares pereira.
during the last centuries of the middle ages, the city expanded substantially and became an important trading post with both northern european and mediterranean cities. early modern most of the portuguese expeditions of the age of discovery left lisbon during the period from the end of the 15th century to the beginning of the 17th century, including vasco da gama's expedition to india in 1498. in 1506, 3,000 jews were massacred in lisbon. the 16th century was lisbon's golden era: the city was the european hub of commerce between africa, india, the far east and later, brazil, and acquired great riches by exploiting the trade in spices, slaves, sugar, textiles and other goods. this period saw the rise of the exuberant manueline style in architecture, which left its mark in many 16th century monuments (including lisbon's belém tower and jerónimos monastery, which were declared unesco world heritage sites). a description of lisbon in the 16th century was written by damião de góis and published in 1554.
portugal lost its independence to spain after the succession crisis of 1580, initiating a sixty-year period of dual monarchy in portugal and spain under the spanish habsburgs. this is referred to as the philippine dominion (domínio filipino), since all three spanish kings during that period were called philip (filipe). the portuguese restoration war, which began with a coup d'état organised by the nobility and bourgeoisie in lisbon and executed on 1 december 1640, restored portuguese independence. the period from 1640 to 1668 was marked by periodic skirmishes between portugal and spain, as well as short episodes of more serious warfare, until the treaty of lisbon was signed in 1668.
in the early 18th century, gold from brazil allowed king john v to sponsor the building of several baroque churches and theatres in the city. prior to the 18th century, lisbon had experienced several significant earthquakes – eight in the 14th century, five in the 16th century (including the 1531 earthquake that destroyed 1,500 houses and the 1597 earthquake in which three streets vanished), and three in the 17th century. on 1 november 1755, the city was destroyed by another devastating earthquake, which killed an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 lisbon residents of a population estimated at between 200,000 and 275,000, and destroyed 85 percent of the city's structures. among several important buildings of the city, the ribeira palace and the hospital real de todos os santos were lost. in coastal areas, such as peniche, situated about 80 km (50 mi) north of lisbon, many people were killed by the following tsunami.
by 1755, lisbon was one of the largest cities in europe; the catastrophic event shocked the whole of europe and left a deep impression on its collective psyche. voltaire wrote a long poem, poême sur le désastre de lisbonne, shortly after the quake, and mentioned it in his 1759 novel candide (indeed, many argue that this critique of optimism was inspired by that earthquake). oliver wendell holmes, sr. also mentions it in his 1857 poem, the deacon's masterpiece, or the wonderful one-hoss shay. after the 1755 earthquake, the city was rebuilt largely according to the plans of prime minister sebastião josé de carvalho e melo, the 1st marquess of pombal; the lower town began to be known as the baixa pombalina (pombaline central district). instead of rebuilding the medieval town, pombal decided to demolish what remained after the earthquake and rebuild the city centre in accordance with principles of modern urban design. it was reconstructed in an open rectangular plan with two great squares: the praça do rossio and the praça do comércio. the first, the central commercial district, is the traditional gathering place of the city and the location of the older cafés, theatres and restaurants; the second became the city's main access to the river tagus and point of departure and arrival for seagoing vessels, adorned by a triumphal arch (1873) and monument to king joseph i. late modern and contemporary in the first years of the 19th century, portugal was invaded by the troops of napoléon bonaparte, forcing queen maria i and prince-regent john (future john vi) to flee temporarily to brazil. by the time the new king returned to lisbon, many of the buildings and properties were pillaged, sacked or destroyed by the invaders.
during the 19th century, the liberal movement introduced new changes into the urban landscape. the principal areas were in the baixa and along the chiado district, where shops, tobacconists shops, cafés, bookstores, clubs and theatres proliferated. the development of industry and commerce determined the growth of the city, seeing the transformation of the passeio público, a pombaline era park, into the avenida da liberdade, as the city grew farther from the tagus.
lisbon was the site of the regicide of carlos i of portugal in 1908, an event which culminated two years later in the first republic.
the city refounded its university in 1911 after centuries of inactivity in lisbon, incorporating reformed former colleges and other non-university higher education schools of the city (such as the escola politécnica – now faculdade de ciências). today there are two public universities in the city (university of lisbon and new university of lisbon), a public university institute (iscte - lisbon university institute) and a polytechnic institute (ipl – instituto politécnico de lisboa). during world war ii, lisbon was one of the very few neutral, open european atlantic ports, a major gateway for refugees to the u.s. and a haven for spies. more than 100,000 refugees were able to flee nazi germany via lisbon.
during the estado novo regime (1926–1974), lisbon was expanded at the cost of other districts within the country, resulting in nationalist and monumental projects. new residential and public developments were constructed; the zone of belém was modified for the 1940 portuguese exhibition, while along the periphery new districts appeared to house the growing population. the inauguration of the bridge over the tagus allowed rapid connection between both sides of the river.
lisbon was the site of three revolutions in the 20th century. the first, the 5 october 1910 revolution, brought an end to the portuguese monarchy and established the highly unstable and corrupt portuguese first republic. the 6 june 1926 revolution would see the end of that first republic and firmly establish the estado novo, or the portuguese second republic, as the ruling regime. the final revolution, the carnation revolution, would take place on 25 april 1974 and would end the right-wing estado novo and reform the country as the current portuguese third republic. in the 1990s, many of the districts were renovated and projects in the historic quarters were established to modernise those areas; architectural and patrimonial buildings were renovated; the northern margin of the tagus was re-purposed for leisure and residential use; the vasco da gama bridge was constructed; and the eastern part of the municipality was re-purposed for expo '98, to commemorate the 500th anniversary of vasco da gama's sea voyage to india, a voyage that would bring immense riches to lisbon and cause many of lisbon's landmarks to be built.
in 1988, a fire in the historical district of chiado saw the destruction of many 18th century pombaline style buildings. a series of restoration works has brought the area back to its former self and made it a high-scale shopping district.
the lisbon agenda was a european union agreement on measures to revitalise the eu economy, signed in lisbon in march 2000. in october 2007 lisbon hosted the 2007 eu summit, where agreement was reached regarding a new eu governance model. the resulting treaty of lisbon was signed on 13 december 2007 and came into force on 1 december 2009.
lisbon has been the site for many international events and programmes. in 1994, lisbon was the european capital of culture. on 3 november 2005, lisbon hosted the mtv european music awards. on 7 july 2007, lisbon held the ceremony of the new 7 wonders of the world election, in the luz stadium, with live transmission for millions of people all over the world. every two years, lisbon hosts the rock in rio lisboa music festival, one of the largest in the world. lisbon hosted the nato summit (19–20 november 2010), a summit meeting that is regarded as a periodic opportunity for heads of state and heads of government of nato member states to evaluate and provide strategic direction for alliance activities. geography physical geography lisbon is located at 38°42′49.75″n 9°8′21.79″w, situated at the mouth of the tagus river and is the westernmost capital of a mainland european country.
the westernmost part of lisbon is occupied by the parque florestal de monsanto (english: monsanto forest park), a 10 km2 (4 sq mi) urban park, one of the largest in europe, and occupying ten percent of the municipality.
the city occupies an area of 100.05 km2 (39 sq mi), and its city boundaries, unlike those of most major cities, coincide with those of the municipality. the rest of the urbanised area of the lisbon metropolitan area, known generically as greater lisbon (portuguese: grande lisboa), is actually several administratively defined cities and municipalities, such as amadora, queluz, agualva-cacém, odivelas, loures, sacavém, almada, barreiro, seixal and oeiras climate lisbon has a mediterranean climate (köppen climate classification: csa) with mild, rainy winters and warm to hot, dry summers. the average annual temperature is 21.3 °c (70.3 °f) during the day and 13.5 °c (56.3 °f) at night.
in the coldest month – january – the high temperature during the day typically ranges from 11 to 18 °c (52 to 64 °f), the low temperature at night ranges from 3 to 13 °c (37 to 55 °f) and the average sea temperature is 15 °c (59 °f). in the warmest month – august – the high temperature during the day typically ranges from 26 to 30 °c (79 to 86 °f), the low temperature at night ranges from 17 to 21 °c (63 to 70 °f) and the average sea temperature is 18 °c (64 °f).
generally, a summer season lasts about 4 months, from june to september. may and october are transitional, in those months the temperature often exceeds 20 °c (68 °f), and a few times it can exceed 25 °c (77 °f)
among european cities with a population above 500,000 (less than valencia or málaga), lisbon has one of the warmest winters, and one of the mildest night time temperatures, from an average of 8.3 °c (46.9 °f) in the coldest month, and 18.6 °c (65.5 °f) in the warmest month. the minimum temperature recorded in lisboa was −1.2 °c (30 °f) in february 1956 and −1 °c (30 °f) in january 1985. the maximum temperature recorded in lisboa was 42 °c (108 °f) on 1 august 2003
rain occurs mainly in winter, the summers being generally dry. sunshine hours are about 2,800 per year, from an average of 4.6 hours of sunshine duration per day in december to an average of 11.4 hours of sunshine duration per day in july. civil parishes the municipality of lisbon included 53 freguesias (civil parishes) until november 2012. a new law (lei n.º 56/2012) reduced the number of freguesias to the following 24: districts locally, lisbon's inhabitants may more commonly refer to the spaces of lisbon in terms of historic bairros (neighbourhoods). these communities have no clearly defined boundaries and represent distinctive quarters of the city that have in common a historical culture, similar living standards, and identifiable architectural landmarks, as exemplified by the bairro alto, alfama, chiado, and so forth. alcântara although today it is quite central, it was once a mere suburb of lisbon, comprising mostly farms and country estates of the nobility with their palaces. in the 16th century, there was a brook there which the nobles used to promenade in their boats. during the late 19th century, alcântara became a popular industrial area, with lots of small factories and warehouses.
in the early 1990s, alcântara began to attract youth because of the number of pubs and discothèques. this was mainly due to its outer area of mostly commercial buildings, which acted as barriers to the noise-generating nightlife (which acted as a buffer to the residential communities surrounding it). in the meantime, some of these areas began to become gentrified, attracting loft developments and new flats, which have profited from its river views and central location.
the riverfront of alcântara is known for its clubs and bars. the area is commonly known as docas (docks), since most of the clubs and bars are housed in converted dock warehouses. alfama the oldest district of lisbon, it spreads down the southern slope from the castle of são jorge to the river tagus. its name, derived from the arabic al-hamma, means fountains or baths. during the islamic invasion of iberia, the alfama constituted the largest part of the city, extending west to the baixa neighbourhood. increasingly, the alfama became inhabited by fishermen and the poor: its fame as a poor neighbourhood continues to this day. while the 1755 lisbon earthquake caused considerable damage throughout the capital, the alfama survived with little damage, thanks to its compact labyrinth of narrow streets and small squares. it is an historical quarter of mixed-use buildings occupied by fado bars, restaurants, and homes with small shops downstairs. modernising trends have invigorated the district: old houses have been re-purposed or remodelled, while new buildings have been constructed. fado, the typically portuguese style of melancholy music, is common (but not obligatory) in the restaurants of the district. mouraria the mouraria, or moorish quarter, is one of the most traditional neighborhoods of lisbon, although most of its old buildings were demolished by the estado novo between the 1930s and the 1970s. it takes its name from the fact that after the reconquest of lisbon, the muslims who remained were confined to this part of the city. in turn, the jews were confined to three neighbourhoods called judiarias bairro alto bairro alto (literally the upper quarter in portuguese) is an area of central lisbon that functions as a residential, shopping and entertainment district; it is the centre of the portuguese capital's nightlife, attracting hipster youth and members of various music subcultures. lisbon's punk, gay, metal, goth, hip hop and reggae scenes all find a home in the bairro with its many clubs and bars that cater to them. the crowds in the bairro alto are a multicultural mix of people representing a broad cross-section of modern portuguese society, many of them being entertainment seekers and devotees of various music genres outside the mainstream, yet fado, portugal's national music, still survives in the midst of the new nightlife. baixa the heart of the city is the baixa or city centre; the pombaline baixa is an elegant district, primarily constructed after the 1755 lisbon earthquake, taking its name from its benefactor, 1st marquess of pombal, sebastião josé de carvalho e melo, who was the minister of joseph i of portugal (1750–1777) and a key figure during the portuguese enlightenment. following the 1755 disaster, pombal took the lead in rebuilding lisbon, imposing strict conditions and guidelines on the construction of the city, and transforming the organic street plan that characterised the district before the earthquake into its current grid pattern. as a result, the pombaline baixa is one of the first examples of earthquake-resistant construction. architectural models were tested by having troops march around them to simulate an earthquake. notable features of pombaline structures include the pombaline cage, a symmetrical wood-lattice framework aimed at distributing earthquake forces, and inter-terrace walls that were built higher than roof timbers to inhibit the spread of fires. belém belém is famous as the place from which many of the great portuguese explorers set off on their voyages of discovery. in particular, it is the place from which vasco da gama departed for india in 1497 and pedro Álvares cabral departed for brazil in 1499. it is also a former royal residence and features the 17th–18th century belém palace, a former royal residence now occupied by the president of portugal, and the ajuda palace, begun in 1802 but never completed.
perhaps belém's most famous feature is its tower, torre de belém, whose image is much used by lisbon's tourist board. the tower was built as a fortified lighthouse late in the reign of dom manuel l (1515–1520) to guard the entrance to the port. it stood on a little island in right side of the tagus, surrounded by water. belém's other major historical building is the mosteiro dos jerónimos (jerónimos monastery), which the torre de belém was built partly to defend. belém's most notable modern feature is the padrão dos descobrimentos (monument to the discoveries) built for the portuguese world fair in 1940. in the heart of belém is the praça do império: gardens centred upon a large fountain, laid out during world war ii. to the west of the gardens lies the centro cultural de belém. belém is one of the most visited lisbon districts. here is located the estádio do restelo, house of belenenses. chiado the chiado is a traditional shopping area that mixes old and modern commercial establishments, concentrated specially in the rua do carmo and the rua garrett. locals as well as tourists visit the chiado to buy books, clothing and pottery as well as to have a cup of coffee. the most famous café of chiado is a brasileira, famous for having had poet fernando pessoa among its customers. the chiado is also an important cultural area, with several museums and theatres, including the opera. several buildings of the chiado were destroyed in a fire in 1988, an event that deeply shocked the country. thanks to a renovation project that lasted more than 10 years, coordinated by celebrated architect siza vieira, the affected area has now virtually recovered. the ornate, late 18th-century estrela basilica is the main attraction of this district. the church with its large dome is located on a hill in what was at the time the western part of lisbon and can be seen from great distances. the style is similar to that of the mafra national palace, late baroque and neoclassical. the façade has twin bell towers and includes statues of saints and some allegorical figures. são bento palace, the seat of the portuguese parliament and the official residences of the prime minister of portugal and the president of the assembly of the republic of portugal, are in this district. also in this district is estrela park, a favorite with families. there are exotic plants and trees, a duck pond, various sculptures, a children's playground, and many cultural events going on through the year, including outdoor cinema, markets, and music festivals. parque das nações parque das nações (park of nations) is the newest district in lisbon, having emerged from an urban renewal programme leading to the world exhibition of lisbon 1998, also known as expo'98. the area suffered massive changes giving parque das nações a futuristic look. a long lasting legacy of the same, the area has become another commercial and higher end residential area for the city. central to this is the gare do oriente (orient railway station), one of the main transport hubs of lisbon for trains, buses, taxis and the metro. its glass and steel columns are inspired by gothic architecture, lending the whole structure a visual fascination (especially in sunlight or when illuminated at night). it was designed by the architect santiago calatrava from valencia, spain. across the street, through vasco da gama mall, is parque das nações (park of the nations), site of the 1998 world expo.
the area is pedestrian-friendly with new buildings, restaurants, gardens, the casino lisbon, the fil building (international exhibition and fair), the camões theatre, as well as the oceanário de lisboa (lisbon oceanarium), the second largest in the world. the district's meo arena has become lisbon's jack-of-all-trades performance arena. seating 20,000, it has staged events from concerts to basketball tournaments. culture the city of lisbon is rich in architecture; romanesque, gothic, manueline, baroque, modern and postmodern constructions can be found all over lisbon. the city is also crossed by historical boulevards and monuments along the main thoroughfares, particularly in the upper districts; notable among these are the avenida da liberdade (avenue of liberty), avenida fontes pereira de melo, avenida almirante reis and avenida da república (avenue of the republic).
there are several substantial museums in the city. the most famous ones are the museu nacional de arte antiga (national museum of ancient art), the national azulejo museum, the museu calouste gulbenkian (calouste gulbenkian museum), containing varied collections of ancient and modern art, the museu nacional do traje e da moda (national museum of costume and fashion), the berardo collection museum (modern art) at the belém cultural center, the museu da electricidade (electricity museum), the museu nacional dos coches (national coach museum, containing the largest collection of royal coaches in the world), the national museum of natural history and science, museum of the orient, and the lisbon city museum.
lisbon's opera house, the teatro nacional de são carlos, hosts a relatively active cultural agenda, mainly in autumn and winter. other important theatres and musical houses are the centro cultural de belém, the teatro nacional d. maria ii, the gulbenkian foundation, and the teatro camões. the monument to christ the king (cristo-rei) stands on the southern bank of the tagus river, in almada. with open arms, overlooking the whole city, it resembles the corcovado monument in rio de janeiro, and was built after world war ii, as a memorial of thanksgiving for portugal's being spared the horrors and destruction of the war.
13 june is lisbon´s holiday in honour of the city's saint, anthony of lisbon (portuguese: santo antónio). saint anthony, also known as saint anthony of padua, was a wealthy portuguese bohemian who was canonised and made doctor of the church after a life preaching to the poor. although lisbon’s patron saint is saint vincent of saragossa, whose remains are housed in the sé cathedral, there are no festivities associated with this saint. eduardo vii park, the second largest park in the city following the parque florestal de monsanto (monsanto forest park), extends down the main avenue (avenida da liberdade), with many flowering plants and greenspaces, that includes the permanent collection of subtropical and tropical plants in the winter garden (portuguese: estufa fria). originally named parque da liberdade, it was renamed in honour of edward vii of england who visited lisbon in 1903.
lisbon is home every year to the lisbon gay & lesbian film festival, the lisboarte, the doclisboa – lisbon international documentary film festival, the festival internacional de máscaras e comediantes, the lisboa mágica – street magic world festival, the monstra – animated film festival, the lisbon book fair, the peixe em lisboa – lisbon fish and flavours, and many others.

in addition, the mosaic portuguese pavement (calçada portuguesa) was born in lisbon, in the mid-1800s. the art has since spread to the rest of the portuguese speaking world. the city remains one of the most expansive examples of the technique, nearly all walkways and even many streets being created and maintained in this style.
in terms of portuguese cities, lisbon was considered the most livable in a survey of living conditions published yearly by expresso.
in may 2018, the city will host the 63rd edition of the eurovision song contest, after the victory of salvador sobral with the song amar pelos dois in kiyv on may 13, 2017. demographics the historical population of the city was around 35,000 in 1300 ad. up to 60,000 in 1400 ad, and rising to 70,000 in 1500 ad. between 1528–1590 the population went from 70,000 to 120,000. 140,000 in 1600 ad, and almost 200,000 in 1700 ad.
the lisbon metropolitan area incorporates two nuts iii (european statistical subdivisions): grande lisboa (greater lisbon), along the northern bank of the tagus river, and península de setúbal (setúbal peninsula), along the southern bank (these two subdivisions make for the região de lisboa (lisbon region). the population density of the city itself is 6,458 inhabitants per square kilometre (16,730/sq mi).
lisbon has 552,700 inhabitants within the administrative center on the area of only 100.05 km2. administratively defined cities that exist in the vicinity of the capital are in fact part of the metropolitan perimeter of lisbon. the urban area has a population of 2,666,000 inhabitants, being the eleventh largest urban area in the european union after paris, london, ruhr area, madrid, milan, barcelona, berlin, rome, naples and athens. the whole metropolis of lisbon (metropolitan area) has about 3 million inhabitants. according to official government data, the lisbon metropolitan area has 3,121,876 inhabitants. other sources also show a similar number, according to the organisation for economic co-operation and development – 2,797,612 inhabitants; according to the department of economic and social affairs of the united nations – 2,890,000; according to the european statistical office eurostat – 2,839,908; according to the brookings institution has 2,968,600 inhabitants. economy the lisbon region is the wealthiest region in portugal and it is well above the european union's gdp per capita average – it produces 45% of the portuguese gdp. lisbon's economy is based primarily on the tertiary sector. most of the headquarters of multinationals operating in portugal are concentrated in the grande lisboa subregion, specially in the oeiras municipality. the lisbon metropolitan area is heavily industrialized, especially the south bank of the tagus river (rio tejo).
the lisbon region is rapidly growing, with gdp (ppp) per capita calculated for each year as follows: €22,745 (2004) – €23,816 (2005) – €25,200 (2006) – €26,100 (2007). the lisbon metropolitan area had a gdp amounting to $96.3 billion, and $32,434 per capita.
the country's chief seaport, featuring one of the largest and most sophisticated regional markets on the iberian peninsula, lisbon and its heavily populated surroundings are also developing as an important financial centre and a dynamic technological hub. automobile manufacturers have erected factories in the suburbs, for example, autoeuropa.
lisbon has the largest and most developed mass media sector of portugal, and is home to several related companies ranging from leading television networks and radio stations to major newspapers. the euronext lisbon stock exchange, part of the pan-european euronext system together with the stock exchanges of amsterdam, brussels and paris, is tied with the new york stock exchange since 2007, forming the multinational nyse euronext group of stock exchanges.
lisbonite industry has very large sectors in oil, as refineries are found just across the tagus, textile mills, shipyards and fishing.
before portugal's sovereign debt crisis and an eu-imf rescue plan, for the decade of 2010 lisbon was expecting to receive many state funded investments, including building a new airport, a new bridge, an expansion of 30 km (18.64 mi) underground, the construction of a mega-hospital (or central hospital), the creation of two lines of a tgv to join madrid, porto, vigo and the rest of europe, the restoration of the main part of the town (between the marquês de pombal roundabout and terreiro do paço), the creation of a large number of bike lanes, as well as modernization and renovation of various facilities. transport the lisbon metro is its main artery, connecting the city centre with the upper and eastern districts and now reaching the suburbs. several expansion projects have been proposed. bus, funicular and tram services have been supplied by carris for over a century in the city and some places in suburbs. trams a traditional form of public transport in lisbon is the tram. introduced in the 19th century, the trams were originally imported from the usa, and called the americanos. the earliest trams can still be seen in the museu da carris (the public transport museum). other than on the modern line 15, the lisbon tramway system still employs small (four wheel) vehicles of a design dating from the early twentieth century. these distinctive yellow trams are one of the tourist icons of modern lisbon, and their size is well suited to the steep hills and narrow streets of the central city. trains there are four commuter train lines departing from lisbon: the cascais, sintra and azambuja lines (operated by cp – comboios de portugal), as well as a fourth line to setúbal (operated by fertagus) crossing the tagus river, over the 25 de abril bridge. the major railway stations are santa apolónia, rossio, gare do oriente, entrecampos, and cais do sodré. buses there are other commuter bus services from the city (connecting cities outside lisbon, and connecting these cities to lisbon): vimeca, rodoviária de lisboa, transportes sul do tejo, boa viagem, barraqueiro are the main ones, operating from different terminals in the city.
lisbon is connected to its suburbs as well as throughout portugal by an extensive motorway network. there are three circular motorways around the city; the 2ª circular, the ic17 (cril), and the a9 (crel). bridges and ferries the city is connected to the far side of the tagus by two important bridges:
the 25 de abril bridge, inaugurated (as ponte salazar) on 6 august 1966, and later renamed after the date of the carnation revolution, was the longest suspension bridge in europe.
the vasco da gama bridge, inaugurated in may 1998 is, at 17.2 km (10.7 mi), the longest bridge in europe.
the foundations for a third bridge across the tagus have already been laid, but the overall project has been postponed due to the economic crisis in portugal and all of europe.
another way of crossing the river is by taking the ferry. the company is transtejo & soflusa, which operates from different points in the city to cacilhas, seixal, montijo, porto brandão and trafaria under the brand transtejo and to barreiro under the brand soflusa. air travel humberto delgado airport is located within the city limits. it is the headquarters and hub for tap portugal as well as a hub for easyjet, azores airlines, ryanair, euroatlantic airways, white airways, and hi fly. a second airport has been proposed, but the project has been put on hold because of the portuguese and european economic crisis, and also because of the long discussion on whether a new airport is needed. however, the last proposal is military air base in montijo that would be replaced by a civil airport. so, lisbon would have two airports, the current airport in north and a new in the south of the city.

amsterdam (; dutch: [ɑmstərˈdɑm]) is the capital and most populous municipality of the kingdom of the netherlands. its status as the capital is mandated by the constitution of the netherlands, although it is not the seat of the government, which is the hague. amsterdam has a population of 851,373 within the city proper, 1,351,587 in the urban area, and 2,410,960 in the amsterdam metropolitan area. the city is located in the province of north holland in the west of the country. the metropolitan area comprises much of the northern part of the randstad, one of the larger conurbations in europe, with a population of approximately 7 million.
amsterdam's name derives from amstelredamme, indicative of the city's origin around a dam in the river amstel. originating as a small fishing village in the late 12th century, amsterdam became one of the most important ports in the world during the dutch golden age (17th century), a result of its innovative developments in trade. during that time, the city was the leading centre for finance and diamonds. in the 19th and 20th centuries the city expanded, and many new neighborhoods and suburbs were planned and built. the 17th-century canals of amsterdam and the 19–20th century defence line of amsterdam are on the unesco world heritage list. since the annexation of municipality sloten in 1921 by the municipality of amsterdam, the oldest historic part of the city lies in sloten (9th century).
as the commercial capital of the netherlands and one of the top financial centres in europe, amsterdam is considered an alpha world city by the globalization and world cities (gawc) study group. the city is also the cultural capital of the netherlands. many large dutch institutions have their headquarters there, and seven of the world's 500 largest companies, including philips and ing, are based in the city. in 2012, amsterdam was ranked the second best city to live in by the economist intelligence unit (eiu) and 12th globally on quality of living for environment and infrastructure by mercer. the city was ranked 3rd in innovation by australian innovation agency 2thinknow in their innovation cities index 2009. the amsterdam seaport to this day remains the second in the country, and the fifth largest seaport in europe.
famous amsterdam residents include the diarist anne frank, artists rembrandt van rijn and vincent van gogh, and philosopher baruch spinoza.
the amsterdam stock exchange, the oldest stock exchange in the world, is located in the city center. amsterdam's main attractions, including its historic canals, the rijksmuseum, the van gogh museum, stedelijk museum, hermitage amsterdam, anne frank house, amsterdam museum, its red-light district, and its many cannabis coffee shops draw more than 5 million international visitors annually. it is also the world's most multicultural city with at least 177 nationalities represented. etymology after the floods of 1170 and 1173, locals near the river amstel built a bridge over the river and a dam across it, giving its name to the village: aemstelredamme. the earliest recorded use of that name is in a document dated october 27, 1275, which exempted inhabitants of the village from paying bridge tolls to count floris v. this allowed the inhabitants of the village of aemstelredamme to travel freely through the county of holland, paying no tolls at bridges, locks and dams. the certificate describes the inhabitants as homines manentes apud amestelledamme (people residing near amestelledamme). by 1327, the name had developed into aemsterdam. history founding and middle ages amsterdam is much younger than dutch cities such as nijmegen, rotterdam, and utrecht. in october 2008, historical geographer chris de bont suggested that the land around amsterdam was being reclaimed as early as the late 10th century. this does not necessarily mean that there was already a settlement then, since reclamation of land may not have been for farming—it may have been for peat, for use as fuel.
amsterdam was granted city rights in either 1300 or 1306. from the 14th century on, amsterdam flourished, largely from trade with the hanseatic league. in 1345, an alleged eucharistic miracle in the kalverstraat rendered the city an important place of pilgrimage until the adoption of the protestant faith. the miracle devotion went underground but was kept alive. in the 19th century, especially after the jubilee of 1845, the devotion was revitalized and became an important national point of reference for dutch catholics. the stille omgang—a silent walk or procession in civil attire—is the expression of the pilgrimage within the protestant netherlands since the late 19th century. in the heyday of the silent walk, up to 90,000 pilgrims came to amsterdam. in the 21st century this has reduced to about 5000. conflict with spain in the 16th century, the dutch rebelled against philip ii of spain and his successors. the main reasons for the uprising were the imposition of new taxes, the tenth penny, and the religious persecution of protestants by the newly introduced inquisition. the revolt escalated into the eighty years' war, which ultimately led to dutch independence. strongly pushed by dutch revolt leader william the silent, the dutch republic became known for its relative religious tolerance. jews from the iberian peninsula, huguenots from france, prosperous merchants and printers from flanders, and economic and religious refugees from the spanish-controlled parts of the low countries found safety in amsterdam. the influx of flemish printers and the city's intellectual tolerance made amsterdam a centre for the european free press. centre of the dutch golden age the 17th century is considered amsterdam's golden age, during which it became the wealthiest city in the western world. ships sailed from amsterdam to the baltic sea, north america, and africa, as well as present-day indonesia, india, sri lanka, and brazil, forming the basis of a worldwide trading network. amsterdam's merchants had the largest share in both the dutch east india company and the dutch west india company. these companies acquired overseas possessions that later became dutch colonies. amsterdam was europe's most important point for the shipment of goods and was the leading financial centre of the western world. in 1602, the amsterdam office of the international trading dutch east india company became the world's first stock exchange by trading in its own shares. the bank of amsterdam started operations in 1609, acting as a full service bank for dutch merchant bankers and as a reserve bank. decline and modernisation amsterdam's prosperity declined during the 18th and early 19th centuries. the wars of the dutch republic with england and france took their toll on amsterdam. during the napoleonic wars, amsterdam's significance reached its lowest point, with holland being absorbed into the french empire. however, the later establishment of the united kingdom of the netherlands in 1815 marked a turning point. the end of the 19th century is sometimes called amsterdam's second golden age. new museums, a railway station, and the concertgebouw were built; in this same time, the industrial revolution reached the city. the amsterdam–rhine canal was dug to give amsterdam a direct connection to the rhine, and the north sea canal was dug to give the port a shorter connection to the north sea. both projects dramatically improved commerce with the rest of europe and the world. in 1906, joseph conrad gave a brief description of amsterdam as seen from the seaside, in the mirror of the sea. 20th century shortly before the first world war, the city started to expand again, and new suburbs were built. even though the netherlands remained neutral in this war, amsterdam suffered a food shortage, and heating fuel became scarce. the shortages sparked riots in which several people were killed. these riots are known as the aardappeloproer (potato rebellion). people started looting stores and warehouses in order to get supplies, mainly food. on 1 january 1921, after a flood in 1916, the depleted municipalities of durgerdam, holysloot, zunderdorp and schellingwoude, all lying north of amsterdam, were, at their own request, annexed to the city.
between the wars, the city continued to expand, most notably to the west of the jordaan district in the frederik hendrikbuurt and surrounding neighbourhoods.
germany invaded the netherlands on 10 may 1940 and took control of the country. some amsterdam citizens sheltered jews, thereby exposing themselves and their families to a high risk of being imprisoned or sent to concentration camps. more than 100,000 dutch jews were deported to nazi concentration camps, of whom some 60,000 lived in amsterdam. perhaps the most famous deportee was the young jewish girl anne frank, who died in the bergen-belsen concentration camp. at the end of the second world war, communication with the rest of the country broke down, and food and fuel became scarce. many citizens travelled to the countryside to forage. dogs, cats, raw sugar beets, and tulip bulbs—cooked to a pulp—were consumed to stay alive. most of the trees in amsterdam were cut down for fuel, and all the wood was taken from the apartments of deported jews. many new suburbs, such as osdorp, slotervaart, slotermeer and geuzenveld, were built in the years after the second world war. these suburbs contained many public parks and wide open spaces, and the new buildings provided improved housing conditions with larger and brighter rooms, gardens, and balconies. because of the war and other events of the 20th century, almost the entire city centre had fallen into disrepair. as society was changing, politicians and other influential figures made plans to redesign large parts of it. there was an increasing demand for office buildings, and also for new roads, as the automobile became available to most people. a metro started operating in 1977 between the new suburb of bijlmer and the centre of amsterdam. further plans were to build a new highway above the metro to connect the central station and city centre with other parts of the city.
the required large-scale demolitions began in amsterdam's former jewish neighbourhood. smaller streets, such as the jodenbreestraat, were widened and almost all of their houses were demolished. at the peak of the demolition, the nieuwmarktrellen (nieuwmarkt riots) broke out; the rioters expressed their fury about the demolition caused by the restructuring of the city.
as a result, the demolition was stopped, and the highway was never built; only the metro was completed. only a few streets remained widened. the new city hall was built on the almost completely demolished waterlooplein. meanwhile, large private organisations, such as stadsherstel amsterdam, were founded with the aim of restoring the entire city centre. although the success of this struggle is visible today, efforts for further restoration are still ongoing. the entire city centre has reattained its former splendour and, as a whole, is now a protected area. many of its buildings have become monuments, and in july 2010 the grachtengordel (the three concentric canals, herengracht, keizersgracht, and prinsengracht) was added to the unesco world heritage list. 21st century in the early years of the 21st century, the amsterdam city centre has attracted large numbers of tourists: between 2012 and 2015, the annual number of visitors rose from 10 million to 17 million. real estate prices have surged, and local shops are making way for tourist-oriented ones, making the centre unaffordable for the city's inhabitants. these developments have evoked comparisons with venice, a city thought to be overwhelmed by the tourist influx.
construction of a metro line connecting the part of the city north of the river (or lake) ij to the centre was started in 2003. the project is controversial because its cost had exceeded its budget by a factor three by 2008, because of fears of damage to buildings in the centre, and because construction had to be halted and restarted multiple times.
since 2014, renewed focus has been given to urban regeneration and renewal, especially in areas directly bordering the city centre, such as frederik hendrikbuurt. this urban renewal and expansion of the traditional centre of the city is part of the structural vision amsterdam 2040 initiative. geography amsterdam is in the western netherlands, in the province of north holland. the river amstel ends in the city centre and connects to a large number of canals that eventually terminate in the ij. amsterdam is about 2 metres (6.6 feet) below sea level. the surrounding land is flat as it is formed of large polders. a man-made forest, amsterdamse bos, is in the southwest. amsterdam is connected to the north sea through the long north sea canal.
amsterdam is intensely urbanised, as is the amsterdam metropolitan area surrounding the city. comprising 219.4 square kilometres (84.7 square miles) of land, the city proper has 4,457 inhabitants per km2 and 2,275 houses per km2. parks and nature reserves make up 12% of amsterdam's land area. canals amsterdam has more than 100 kilometres (60 miles) of canals, most of which are navigable by boat. the three main canals are prinsengracht, herengracht, and keizersgracht. in the middle ages, amsterdam was surrounded by a moat, called the singel, which now forms the innermost ring in the city, and makes the city centre a horseshoe shape. the city is also served by a seaport. it has been compared with venice, due to its division into about 90 islands, which are linked by more than 1,200 bridges. climate amsterdam has an oceanic climate (köppen climate classification cfb) strongly influenced by its proximity to the north sea to the west, with prevailing westerly winds. both winters and summers are considered mild, although winters can get quite cold, while summers are quite warm occasionally. amsterdam, as well as most of the north holland province, lies in usda hardiness zone 8b. frosts mainly occur during spells of easterly or northeasterly winds from the inner european continent. even then, because amsterdam is surrounded on three sides by large bodies of water, as well as having a significant heat-island effect, nights rarely fall below −5 °c (23 °f), while it could easily be −12 °c (10 °f) in hilversum, 25 kilometres (16 miles) southeast. summers are moderately warm with a number of hot days every month. the average daily high in august is 22.1 °c (71.8 °f), and 30 °c (86 °f) or higher is only measured on average on 2.5 days, placing amsterdam in ahs heat zone 2. the record extremes range from −15.4 °c (4.3 °f) to 34.5 °c (94.1 °f). days with more than 1 millimetre (0.04 in) of precipitation are common, on average 133 days per year. amsterdam's average annual precipitation is 838 millimetres (33 in), more than what is measured at amsterdam schiphol airport. a large part of this precipitation falls as light rain or brief showers. cloudy and damp days are common during the cooler months of october through march. demographics historical population compared to other important towns in the county of holland, such as dordrecht, leiden, haarlem, delft and alkmaar, amsterdam is a relatively young city. in stark contrast to the relative decline of those other towns, amsterdam's population grew in the 15th and 16th centuries, mainly due to the rise of the profitable baltic maritime trade after the burgundian victory in the dutch–hanseatic war. still, the population of amsterdam and other towns in holland was only modest compared to the towns and cities of flanders and brabant, which comprised the most urbanised area of the low countries.
this changed when, during the dutch revolt, many people from the southern netherlands fled to the north, especially after antwerp fell to spanish forces in 1585. in thirty years, amsterdam's population more than doubled from 41,362 inhabitants in 1590 to 106,500 inhabitants in 1620. during the 1660s, amsterdam's population reached 200,000. the city's growth levelled off and the population stabilised around 240,000 for most of the 18th century.
at the turn of the 18th century, amsterdam was the fourth largest city in europe, behind constantinople (about 700,000), london (550,000) and paris (530,000). this was all the more remarkable as amsterdam was neither the capital city nor the seat of government of the dutch republic, which itself was a much smaller state than england, france or the ottoman empire. in contrast to those other metropolises, amsterdam was also surrounded by large towns such as leiden (about 67,000), rotterdam (45,000), haarlem (38,000), and utrecht (30,000).
the city's population declined in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, dipping under 200,000 in 1820. by the second half of the 19th century, industrialisation spurred renewed growth. amsterdam's population hit an all-time high of 872,000 in 1959, before declining in the following decades due to government-sponsored suburbanisation to so-called groeikernen (growth centres) such as purmerend and almere. between 1970 and 1980, amsterdam experienced its sharpest population decline ever, and by 1985 the city had only 675,570 residents. this was soon followed by reurbanisation and gentrification, however, leading to renewed population growth in the 2010s. the municipal department for research, information and statistics expects a new record population to be set in 2020. immigration in the 16th and 17th century non-dutch immigrants to amsterdam were mostly huguenots, flemings, sephardi jews and westphalians. huguenots came after the edict of fontainebleau in 1685, while the flemish protestants came during the eighty years' war. the westphalians came to amsterdam mostly for economic reasons – their influx continued through the 18th and 19th centuries. before the second world war, 10% of the city population was jewish. just twenty per cent of them survived the shoah.
the first mass immigration in the 20th century were by people from indonesia, who came to amsterdam after the independence of the dutch east indies in the 1940s and 1950s. in the 1960s guest workers from turkey, morocco, italy and spain emigrated to amsterdam. after the independence of suriname in 1975, a large wave of surinamese settled in amsterdam, mostly in the bijlmer area. other immigrants, including refugees asylum seekers and illegal immigrants, came from europe, america, asia, and africa. in the 1970s and 1980s, many 'old' amsterdammers moved to 'new' cities like almere and purmerend, prompted by the third planological bill of the dutch government. this bill promoted suburbanisation and arranged for new developments in so-called groeikernen, literally cores of growth. young professionals and artists moved into neighbourhoods de pijp and the jordaan abandoned by these amsterdammers. the non-western immigrants settled mostly in the social housing projects in amsterdam-west and the bijlmer. today, people of non-western origin make up approximately one-third of the population of amsterdam, and more than 50% of the city' s children. segregation along ethnic lines is clearly visible, with people of non-western origin, considered a separate group by statistics netherlands, concentrating in specific neighbourhoods especially in nieuw-west, zeeburg, bijlmer and in certain areas of amsterdam-noord.
in 2000, christians formed the largest religious group in the city (27% of the population). the next largest religion was islam (14%), most of whose followers were sunni.
there is a japanese population resident in amsterdam. the japanese school of amsterdam serves elementary and junior high school students. as of 2014 8% of the student body of the international school amsterdam in nearby amstelveen was japanese; this figure was 40% in 1997. as of 1997 most japanese children who lived in the netherlands attended high schools and universities located in japan. religions in 1578 the previously roman catholic city of amsterdam joined the revolt against spanish rule, late in comparison to other major northern dutch cities. in line with protestant procedure of that time, all churches were converted to protestant worship. calvinism became the dominant religion, and although catholicism was not forbidden and priests allowed to serve, the catholic hierarchy was prohibited. this led to the establishment of schuilkerken, covert churches, behind seemingly ordinary canal side house fronts. one example is the current debate centre de rode hoed. a large influx of foreigners of many religions came to 17th-century amsterdam, in particular sefardic jews from spain and portugal, huguenots from france, and protestants from the southern netherlands. this led to the establishment of many non-dutch-speaking religious churches. in 1603, the first notification was made of jewish religious service. in 1639, the first synagogue was consecrated. the jews came to call the town jerusalem of the west, a reference to their sense of belonging there. as they became established in the city, other christian denominations used converted catholic chapels to conduct their own services. the oldest english-language church congregation in the world outside the united kingdom is found at the begijnhof. regular services there are still offered in english under the auspices of the church of scotland. the huguenots accounted for nearly 20% of amsterdam's inhabitants in 1700. being calvinists, they soon integrated into the dutch reformed church, though often retaining their own congregations. some, commonly referred by the moniker 'walloon', are recognisable today as they offer occasional services in french.
in the second half of the 17th century, amsterdam experienced an influx of ashkenazim, jews from central and eastern europe, which continued into the 19th century. jews often fled the pogroms in those areas. the first ashkenazi who arrived in amsterdam were refugees from the chmielnicki uprising in poland and the thirty years' war. they not only founded their own synagogues, but had a strong influence on the 'amsterdam dialect' adding a large yiddish local vocabulary.
despite an absence of an official jewish ghetto, most jews preferred to live in the eastern part of the old medieval heart of the city. the main street of this jewish neighbourhood was the jodenbreestraat. the neighbourhood comprised the waterlooplein and the nieuwmarkt. buildings in this neighbourhood fell into disrepair after the second world war, and a large section of the neighbourhood was demolished during the construction of the subway. this led to riots, and as a result the original plans for large-scale reconstruction were abandoned and the neighbourhood was rebuilt with smaller-scale residence buildings on the basis of its original layout. catholic churches in amsterdam have been constructed since the restoration of the episcopal hierarchy in 1853. one of the principal architects behind the city's catholic churches, cuypers, was also responsible for the amsterdam central station and the rijksmuseum, which led to a refusal of protestant king william iii to open 'that monastery'. in 1924, the roman catholic church of the netherlands hosted the international eucharistic congress in amsterdam, and numerous catholic prelates visited the city, where festivities were held in churches and stadiums. catholic processions on the public streets, however, were still forbidden under law at the time. only in the 20th century was amsterdam's relation to catholicism normalised, but despite its far larger population size, the catholic clergy chose to place its episcopal see of the city in the nearby provincial town of haarlem.
in recent times, religious demographics in amsterdam have been changed by large-scale immigration from former colonies. immigrants from suriname have introduced evangelical protestantism and lutheranism, from the hernhutter variety; hinduism has been introduced mainly from suriname; and several distinct branches of islam have been brought from various parts of the world. islam is now the largest non-christian religion in amsterdam. the large community of ghanaian and nigerian immigrants have established african churches, often in parking garages in the bijlmer area, where many have settled. in addition, a broad array of other religious movements have established congregations, including buddhism, confucianism and hinduism. jews make up about 2% of the city's total population. tolerance and ethnic tension although the saying leef en laat leven or live and let live summarises the dutch and especially the amsterdam open and tolerant society, the increased influx of religions and cultures after the second world war, has on a number of occasions strained social relations. with 180 different nationalities, amsterdam is home to one of the widest varieties of nationalities of any city in the world. the proportion of the population of immigrant origin in the city proper is about 50% and 88% of the population are dutch citizens.
the city has been at times marked by ethnic tension. in 2004 film director theo van gogh was murdered in amsterdam. in line with attitude changes in dutch politics towards certain minorities, turkish-language and arabic-language tv channels have been dropped from the basic cable tv package. in recent years, politicians are actively discouraged from campaigning in minority languages to encourage assimilation. in the local elections of 2010 politicians were criticised by current amsterdam mayor mr van der laan (then minister of integration) for distributing election leaflets in minority languages and in some cases leaflets were collected. due to this alleged anti-multicultural stand, van der laan has been accused of hypocrisy by his own party's pvda main candidate. also during the same period, possibly due to his belief in integration via (possibly not always voluntary) assimilation, amsterdam has been one of the municipalities in the netherlands which provided immigrants with extensive and free dutch-language courses, which have benefited many immigrants. cityscape and architecture amsterdam fans out south from the amsterdam centraal railway station and damrak, the main street off the station. the oldest area of the town is known as de wallen (the quays). it lies to the east of damrak and contains the city's famous red light district. to the south of de wallen is the old jewish quarter of waterlooplein. the medieval and colonial age canals of amsterdam, known as grachten, embraces the heart of the city where homes have interesting gables. beyond the grachtengordel are the former working class areas of jordaan and de pijp. the museumplein with the city's major museums, the vondelpark, a 19th-century park named after the dutch writer joost van den vondel, and the plantage neighbourhood, with the zoo, are also located outside the grachtengordel.
several parts of the city and the surrounding urban area are polders. this can be recognised by the suffix -meer which means lake, as in aalsmeer, bijlmermeer, haarlemmermeer, and watergraafsmeer. canals the amsterdam canal system is the result of conscious city planning. in the early 17th century, when immigration was at a peak, a comprehensive plan was developed that was based on four concentric half-circles of canals with their ends emerging at the ij bay. known as the grachtengordel, three of the canals were mostly for residential development: the herengracht (where heren refers to heren regeerders van de stad amsterdam (ruling lords of amsterdam), and gracht means canal, so the name can be roughly translated as canal of the lords), keizersgracht (emperor's canal), and prinsengracht (prince's canal). the fourth and outermost canal is the singelgracht, which is often not mentioned on maps, because it is a collective name for all canals in the outer ring. the singelgracht should not be confused with the oldest and most inner canal singel. the canals served for defence, water management and transport. the defences took the form of a moat and earthen dikes, with gates at transit points, but otherwise no masonry superstructures. the original plans have been lost, so historians, such as ed taverne, need to speculate on the original intentions: it is thought that the considerations of the layout were purely practical and defensive rather than ornamental. construction started in 1613 and proceeded from west to east, across the breadth of the layout, like a gigantic windshield wiper as the historian geert mak calls it – and not from the centre outwards, as a popular myth has it. the canal construction in the southern sector was completed by 1656. subsequently, the construction of residential buildings proceeded slowly. the eastern part of the concentric canal plan, covering the area between the amstel river and the ij bay, has never been implemented. in the following centuries, the land was used for parks, senior citizens' homes, theatres, other public facilities, and waterways without much planning. over the years, several canals have been filled in, becoming streets or squares, such as the nieuwezijds voorburgwal and the spui. expansion after the development of amsterdam's canals in the 17th century, the city did not grow beyond its borders for two centuries. during the 19th century, samuel sarphati devised a plan based on the grandeur of paris and london at that time. the plan envisaged the construction of new houses, public buildings and streets just outside the grachtengordel. the main aim of the plan, however, was to improve public health. although the plan did not expand the city, it did produce some of the largest public buildings to date, like the paleis voor volksvlijt.
following sarphati, van niftrik and kalff designed an entire ring of 19th-century neighbourhoods surrounding the city's centre, with the city preserving the ownership of all land outside the 17th-century limit, thus firmly controlling development. most of these neighbourhoods became home to the working class.
in response to overcrowding, two plans were designed at the beginning of the 20th century which were very different from anything amsterdam had ever seen before: plan zuid, designed by the architect berlage, and west. these plans involved the development of new neighbourhoods consisting of housing blocks for all social classes.
after the second world war, large new neighbourhoods were built in the western, southeastern, and northern parts of the city. these new neighbourhoods were built to relieve the city's shortage of living space and give people affordable houses with modern conveniences. the neighbourhoods consisted mainly of large housing blocks situated among green spaces, connected to wide roads, making the neighbourhoods easily accessible by motor car. the western suburbs which were built in that period are collectively called the westelijke tuinsteden. the area to the southeast of the city built during the same period is known as the bijlmer. architecture amsterdam has a rich architectural history. the oldest building in amsterdam is the oude kerk (old church), at the heart of the wallen, consecrated in 1306. the oldest wooden building is het houten huys at the begijnhof. it was constructed around 1425 and is one of only two existing wooden buildings. it is also one of the few examples of gothic architecture in amsterdam. in the 16th century, wooden buildings were razed and replaced with brick ones. during this period, many buildings were constructed in the architectural style of the renaissance. buildings of this period are very recognisable with their stepped gable façades, which is the common dutch renaissance style. amsterdam quickly developed its own renaissance architecture. these buildings were built according to the principles of the architect hendrick de keyser. one of the most striking buildings designed by hendrick de keyer is the westerkerk. in the 17th century baroque architecture became very popular, as it was elsewhere in europe. this roughly coincided with amsterdam's golden age. the leading architects of this style in amsterdam were jacob van campen, philips vingboons and daniel stalpaert. philip vingboons designed splendid merchants' houses throughout the city. a famous building in baroque style in amsterdam is the royal palace on dam square. throughout the 18th century, amsterdam was heavily influenced by french culture. this is reflected in the architecture of that period. around 1815, architects broke with the baroque style and started building in different neo-styles. most gothic style buildings date from that era and are therefore said to be built in a neo-gothic style. at the end of the 19th century, the jugendstil or art nouveau style became popular and many new buildings were constructed in this architectural style. since amsterdam expanded rapidly during this period, new buildings adjacent to the city centre were also built in this style. the houses in the vicinity of the museum square in amsterdam oud-zuid are an example of jugendstil. the last style that was popular in amsterdam before the modern era was art deco. amsterdam had its own version of the style, which was called the amsterdamse school. whole districts were built this style, such as the rivierenbuurt. a notable feature of the façades of buildings designed in amsterdamse school is that they are highly decorated and ornate, with oddly shaped windows and doors.
the old city centre is the focal point of all the architectural styles before the end of the 19th century. jugendstil and georgian are mostly found outside the city's centre in the neighbourhoods built in the early 20th century, although there are also some striking examples of these styles in the city centre. most historic buildings in the city centre and nearby are houses, such as the famous merchants' houses lining the canals. parks and recreational areas amsterdam has many parks, open spaces, and squares throughout the city. vondelpark, the largest park in the city, is located in the oud-zuid borough and is named after the 17th century amsterdam author, joost van den vondel. yearly, the park has around 10 million visitors. in the park is an open-air theatre, a playground and several horeca facilities. in the zuid borough, is beatrixpark, named after queen beatrix. between amsterdam and amstelveen is the amsterdamse bos (amsterdam forest), the largest recreational area in amsterdam. annually, almost 4.5 million people visit the park, which has a size of 1.000 hectares and is approximately three times the size of central park. amstelpark in the zuid borough houses the rieker windmill, which dates to 1636. other parks include sarphatipark in the de pijp neighbourhood, oosterpark in the oost borough, and westerpark in the westerpark neighbourhood. the city has four beaches, the nemo beach, citybeach het stenen hoofd (silodam), blijburg, and one in amsterdam-noord.
the city has many open squares (plein in dutch). the namesake of the city as the site of the original dam, dam square, is the main town square and has the royal palace and national monument. museumplein hosts various museums, including the rijksmuseum, van gogh museum, and stedelijk museum. other squares include rembrandtplein, muntplein, nieuwmarkt, leidseplein, spui, and waterlooplein. also, near to amsterdam is the nekkeveld estate conservation project. economy amsterdam is the financial and business capital of the netherlands. amsterdam is currently one of the best european cities in which to locate an international business. it is ranked fifth in this category and is only surpassed by london, paris, frankfurt and barcelona. many large corporations and banks have their headquarters in amsterdam, including akzo nobel, heineken international, ing group, abn amro, tomtom, delta lloyd group, booking.com and philips. kpmg international's global headquarters is located in nearby amstelveen, where many non-dutch companies have settled as well, because surrounding communities allow full land ownership, contrary to amsterdam's land-lease system.
though many small offices are still located on the old canals, companies are increasingly relocating outside the city centre. the zuidas (english: south axis) has become the new financial and legal hub. the five largest law firms of the netherlands, a number of dutch subsidiaries of large consulting firms like boston consulting group and accenture, and the world trade center amsterdam are also located in zuidas.
there are three other smaller financial districts in amsterdam. the first is the area surrounding amsterdam sloterdijk railway station, where several newspapers like de telegraaf have their offices. also, deloitte, the gemeentelijk vervoerbedrijf (municipal public transport company) and the dutch tax offices (belastingdienst) are located there. the second financial district is the area surrounding amsterdam arena. the third is the area surrounding amsterdam amstel railway station. the tallest building in amsterdam, the rembrandt tower, is situated there, as is the headquarters of philips. port of amsterdam the port of amsterdam is the fourth largest port in europe, the 38th largest port in the world and the second largest port in the netherlands by metric tons of cargo. in 2014 the port of amsterdam had a cargo throughput of 97,4 million tons of cargo, which was mostly bulk cargo. amsterdam has the biggest cruise port in the netherlands with more than 150 cruise ships every year. in 2019 the new lock in ijmuiden will open; the port will then be able to grow to 125 million tonnes in capacity.
the amsterdam stock exchange (aex), now part of euronext, is the world's oldest stock exchange and is one of europe's largest bourses. it is near dam square in the city centre.

on 18 september 2017 it was announced by eberhard van der laan in an open letter to amsterdam citizens that kajsa ollongren would take up his office as acting mayor of amsterdam - with immediate effect - with the resignation of van der laan due to ill health. unlike most other dutch municipalities, amsterdam is subdivided into eight boroughs, called stadsdelen or 'districts', a system that was implemented gradually in the 1980s to improve local governance. the boroughs are responsible for many activities that had previously been run by the central city. in 2010, the number of amsterdam boroughs reached fifteen. fourteen of those had their own district council (deelraad), elected by a popular vote. the fifteenth, westpoort, covers the harbour of amsterdam and had very few residents. therefore, it was governed by the central municipal council. under the borough system, municipal decisions are made at borough level, except for those affairs pertaining to the whole city such as major infrastructure projects, which are the jurisdiction of the central municipal authorities. in 2010, the borough system was restructured, in which many smaller boroughs merged into larger boroughs. in 2014, under a reform of the dutch municipalities act, the amsterdam boroughs lost much of their autonomous status, as their district councils were abolished. the municipal council of amsterdam voted to maintain the borough system by replacing the district councils with smaller, but still directly elected district committees (bestuurscommissies). under a municipal ordinance, the new district committees were granted responsibilities through delegation of regulatory and executive powers by the central municipal council. metropolitan area amsterdam is usually understood to refer to the municipality of amsterdam. colloquially, some areas within the municipality, such as the town of durgerdam, may not be considered part of amsterdam.
statistics netherlands uses three other definitions of amsterdam: metropolitan agglomeration amsterdam (grootstedelijke agglomeratie amsterdam, not to be confused with grootstedelijk gebied amsterdam, a synonym of groot amsterdam), greater amsterdam (groot amsterdam, a corop region) and the urban region amsterdam (stadsgewest amsterdam). the amsterdam department for research and statistics uses a fourth conurbation, namely the stadsregio amsterdam ('city region of amsterdam'). the city region is similar to greater amsterdam but includes the municipalities of zaanstad and wormerland. it excludes graft-de rijp.
the smallest of these areas is the municipality of amsterdam with a population of 802,938 in 2013. the conurbation had a population of 1,096,042 in 2013. it includes the municipalities of zaanstad, wormerland, oostzaan, diemen and amstelveen only, as well as the municipality of amsterdam. greater amsterdam includes 15 municipalities, and had a population of 1,293,208 in 2013. though much larger in area, the population of this area is only slightly larger, because the definition excludes the relatively populous municipality of zaanstad. the largest area by population, the amsterdam metropolitan area (dutch: metropoolregio amsterdam), has a population of 2,33 million. it includes for instance zaanstad, wormerveer, muiden, abcoude, haarlem, almere and lelystad but excludes graft-de rijp. amsterdam is part of the conglomerate metropolitan area randstad, with a total population of 6,659,300 inhabitants.
of these various metropolitan area configurations, only the stadsregio amsterdam (city region of amsterdam) has a formal governmental status. its responsibities include regional spatial planning and the metropolitan public transport concessions. national capital under the dutch constitution, amsterdam is the capital of the netherlands. since the 1983 constitutional revision, the constitution mentions amsterdam and capital in chapter 2, article 32: the king's confirmation by oath and his coronation take place in the capital amsterdam (de hoofdstad amsterdam). previous versions of the constitution only mentioned the city of amsterdam (de stad amsterdam). for a royal investiture, therefore, the states general of the netherlands (the dutch parliament) meets for a ceremonial joint session in amsterdam. the ceremony traditionally takes place at the nieuwe kerk on dam square, immediately after the former monarch has signed the act of abdication at the nearby royal palace of amsterdam. normally, however, the parliament sits in the hague, the city which has historically been the seat of the dutch government, the dutch monarchy, and the dutch supreme court. foreign embassies are also located in the hague. symbols the coat of arms of amsterdam is composed of several historical elements. first and centre are three st andrew's crosses, aligned in a vertical band on the city's shield (although amsterdam's patron saint was saint nicholas). these st andrew's crosses can also be found on the cityshields of neighbours amstelveen and ouder-amstel. this part of the coat of arms is the basis of the flag of amsterdam, flown by the city government, but also as civil ensign for ships registered in amsterdam. second is the imperial crown of austria. in 1489, out of gratitude for services and loans, maximilian i awarded amsterdam the right to adorn its coat of arms with the king's crown. then, in 1508, this was replaced with maximilian's imperial crown when he was crowned holy roman emperor. in the early years of the 17th century, maximilian's crown in amsterdam's coat of arms was again replaced, this time with the crown of emperor rudolph ii, a crown that became the imperial crown of austria. the lions date from the late 16th century, when city and province became part of the republic of the seven united netherlands. last came the city's official motto: heldhaftig, vastberaden, barmhartig (heroic, determined, merciful), bestowed on the city in 1947 by queen wilhelmina, in recognition of the city's bravery during the second world war. transport metro, tram, bus currently, there are sixteen tram routes and four metro routes, with a fifth route to be added when the north/south metro line is completed (due in 2017). all are operated by municipal public transport operator gvb, which also runs the city bus network.fifth route
four fare-free gvb ferries carry pedestrians and cyclists across the ij lake to the borough of amsterdam-noord, and two fare-charging ferries run east and west along the harbour. there are also privately operated water taxis, a water bus, a boat sharing operation, electric rental boats (boaty) and canal cruises, that transport people along amsterdam's waterways.
regional buses, and some suburban buses, are operated by connexxion and ebs. international coach services are provided by eurolines from amsterdam amstel railway station, idbus from amsterdam sloterdijk railway station, and megabus from zuiderzeeweg in the east of the city. car amsterdam was intended in 1932 to be the hub, a kind of kilometre zero, of the highway system of the netherlands, with freeways numbered one to eight planned to originate from the city. the outbreak of the second world war and shifting priorities led to the current situation, where only roads a1, a2, and a4 originate from amsterdam according to the original plan. the a3 road to rotterdam was cancelled in 1970 in order to conserve the groene hart. road a8, leading north to zaandam and the a10 ringroad were opened between 1968 and 1974. besides the a1, a2, a4 and a8, several freeways, such as the a7 and a6, carry traffic mainly bound for amsterdam.
the a10 ringroad surrounding the city connects amsterdam with the dutch national network of freeways. interchanges on the a10 allow cars to enter the city by transferring to one of the 18 city roads, numbered s101 through to s118. these city roads are regional roads without grade separation, and sometimes without a central reservation. most are accessible by cyclists. the s100 centrumring is a smaller ringroad circumnavigating the city's centre.
in the city centre, driving a car is discouraged. parking fees are expensive, and many streets are closed to cars or are one-way. the local government sponsors carsharing and carpooling initiatives such as autodelen and meerijden.nu. national rail amsterdam is served by ten stations of the nederlandse spoorwegen (dutch railways). six are intercity stops: sloterdijk, zuid, amstel, bijlmer arena, lelylaan and amsterdam centraal. the stations for local services are: rai, holendrecht, muiderpoort and science park. amsterdam centraal is also an international railway station. from the station there are regular services to destinations such as austria, belarus, belgium, the czech republic, denmark, france, germany, hungary, poland, russia and switzerland. among these trains are international trains of the nederlandse spoorwegen (amsterdam-berlin) and the thalys (amsterdam-brussels-paris/lille), citynightline, and intercityexpress (amsterdam–cologne–frankfurt). future line: highspeed train amsterdam/london opening end of 2017. airport amsterdam airport schiphol (iata: ams, icao: eham) is less than 20 minutes by train from amsterdam centraal railway station and is served by domestic and international intercity trains, such as thalys and intercity brussel. schiphol is the largest airport in the netherlands, the third largest in europe, and the 14th-largest in the world in terms of passengers. it handles over 60 million passengers per year and is the home base of four airlines, klm, transavia, martinair and arkefly . as of 2014, schiphol was the fifth busiest airport in the world measured by international passenger numbers. cycling amsterdam is one of the most bicycle-friendly large cities in the world and is a centre of bicycle culture with good facilities for cyclists such as bike paths and bike racks, and several guarded bike storage garages (fietsenstalling) which can be used for a nominal fee. in 2013, there were about 1,200,000 bicycles in amsterdam outnumbering the amount of citizens in the city. theft is widespread – in 2011, about 83,000 bicycles were stolen in amsterdam. bicycles are used by all socio-economic groups because of their convenience, amsterdam's small size, the 400 kilometres (249 miles) of bike paths, the flat terrain, and the inconvenience of driving an automobile. education amsterdam has two universities: the university of amsterdam (universiteit van amsterdam), and the vu university amsterdam (vrije universiteit or vu). other institutions for higher education include an art school – gerrit rietveld academie, a university of applied sciences – the hogeschool van amsterdam, and the amsterdamse hogeschool voor de kunsten. amsterdam's international institute of social history is one of the world's largest documentary and research institutions concerning social history, and especially the history of the labour movement. amsterdam's hortus botanicus, founded in the early 17th century, is one of the oldest botanical gardens in the world, with many old and rare specimens, among them the coffee plant that served as the parent for the entire coffee culture in central and south america.
there are over 200 primary schools in amsterdam. some of these primary schools base their teachings on particular pedagogic theories like the various montessori schools. the biggest montessori high school in amsterdam is the montessori lyceum amsterdam. many schools, however, are based on religion. this used to be primarily roman catholicism and various protestant denominations, but with the influx of muslim immigrants there has been a rise in the number of islamic schools. jewish schools can be found in the southern suburbs of amsterdam.
amsterdam is noted for having five independent grammar schools (dutch: gymnasia), the vossius gymnasium, barlaeus gymnasium, st. ignatius gymnasium, het 4e gymnasium and the cygnus gymnasium where a classical curriculum including latin and classical greek is taught. though believed until recently by many to be an anachronistic and elitist concept that would soon die out, the gymnasia have recently experienced a revival, leading to the formation of a fourth and fifth grammar school in which the three aforementioned schools participate. most secondary schools in amsterdam offer a variety of different levels of education in the same school. the city also has various colleges ranging from art and design to politics and economics which are mostly also available for students coming from other countries. notable people frits bolkestein (born 1933), politician

amsterdam is home to the dutch second-largest commercial tv group sbs broadcasting group, consisting of tv-stations sbs 6, net 5 and veronica. however, amsterdam is not considered 'the media city of the netherlands'. the town of hilversum, 30 kilometres (19 miles) south-east of amsterdam, has been crowned with this unofficial title. hilversum is the principal centre for radio and television broadcasting in the netherlands. radio netherlands, heard worldwide via shortwave radio since the 1920s, is also based there. hilversum is home to an extensive complex of audio and television studios belonging to the national broadcast production company nos, as well as to the studios and offices of all the dutch public broadcasting organisations and many commercial tv production companies.
in 2012, the music video of far east movement, 'live my life', was filmed in various parts of amsterdam.
amsterdam is also featured in john green's book 'the fault in our stars,' which has also been made into a film, and part of the film takes place in amsterdam. housing the housing market is heavily regulated. in amsterdam, 55% of existing housing and 30% of new housing is owned by housing associations, which are government sponsored entities.
squat properties are common throughout amsterdam, due to property law strongly favouring tenants. a number of these squats have become well known, such as ot301, paradiso, vrankrijk (closed down by city government), and the binnenpret, and several are now businesses, such as health clubs and licensed restaurants. see also amsterdammertje notes and references literature berns, jan; daan, jo (1993). hij zeit wat: de amsterdamse volkstaal. the hague: bzztôh. isbn 9062917569. frijhoff, willem; prak, maarten (2005), geschiedenis van amsterdam. zelfbewuste stadsstaat 1650–1813, amsterdam: sun, isbn 9058751384 mak, geert (1994), een kleine geschiedenis van amsterdam, amsterdam & antwerp: atlas, isbn 9045019531 charles caspers & peter jan margry (2017), het mirakel van amsterdam. biografie van een betwiste devotie (amsterdam, prometheus).

last name
madrid (, spanish: [maˈðɾið], locally [maˈðɾi(θ)]) is the capital of spain and the largest municipality in both the community of madrid and spain as a whole. the city has almost 3.166 million inhabitants with a metropolitan area population of approximately 6.5 million. it is the third-largest city in the european union (eu) after london and berlin, and its metropolitan area is the third-largest in the eu after those of london and paris. the municipality itself covers an area of 604.3 km2 (233.3 sq mi).
madrid lies on the river manzanares in the centre of both the country and the community of madrid (which comprises the city of madrid, its conurbation and extended suburbs and villages); this community is bordered by the autonomous communities of castile and león and castile-la mancha. as the capital city of spain, seat of government, and residence of the spanish monarch, madrid is also the political, economic and cultural centre of the country. the current mayor is manuela carmena from ahora madrid.
the madrid urban agglomeration has the third-largest gdp in the european union and its influences in politics, education, entertainment, environment, media, fashion, science, culture, and the arts all contribute to its status as one of the world's major global cities. madrid is home to two world-famous football clubs, real madrid and atlético de madrid. due to its economic output, high standard of living, and market size, madrid is considered the major financial centre of southern europe and the iberian peninsula; it hosts the head offices of the vast majority of major spanish companies, such as telefónica, iag or repsol. madrid is the 17th most liveable city in the world according to monocle magazine, in its 2014 index.
madrid houses the headquarters of the world tourism organization (unwto), belonging to the united nations organization (un), the ibero-american general secretariat (segib), the organization of ibero-american states (oei), and the public interest oversight board (piob). it also hosts major international regulators and promoters of the spanish language: the standing committee of the association of spanish language academies, headquarters of the royal spanish academy (rae), the cervantes institute and the foundation of urgent spanish (fundéu bbva). madrid organises fairs such as fitur, arco, simo tci and the cibeles madrid fashion week.
while madrid possesses modern infrastructure, it has preserved the look and feel of many of its historic neighbourhoods and streets. its landmarks include the royal palace of madrid; the royal theatre with its restored 1850 opera house; the buen retiro park, founded in 1631; the 19th-century national library building (founded in 1712) containing some of spain's historical archives; a large number of national museums, and the golden triangle of art, located along the paseo del prado and comprising three art museums: prado museum, the reina sofía museum, a museum of modern art, and the thyssen-bornemisza museum, which completes the shortcomings of the other two museums. cibeles palace and fountain have become one of the monument symbols of the city. etymology مجريط majrīṭ (afi [madʒriːtˁ]) is the first documented reference to the city. it is recorded in andalusian arabic during the al-andalus. the name magerit ([madʒeˈɾit]) was retained in medieval spanish. the most ancient recorded name of the city magerit (for *materit or *mageterit?) comes from the name of a fortress built on the manzanares river in the 9th century ad, and means place of abundant water in arabic. a wider number of theories have been formulated on possible earlier origins.
according to legend, madrid was founded by ocno bianor (son of king tyrrhenius of tuscany and mantua) and was named metragirta or mantua carpetana. others contend that the original name of the city was ursaria (land of bears in latin), because of the many bears that were to be found in the nearby forests, which, together with the strawberry tree (spanish madroño), have been the emblem of the city since the middle ages.
a french expert in ancient gaulish proposed a celtic place-name from ritu- 'ford' (old welsh rit, welsh rhyd, old breton rit, old northern french roy) and a first element, that is not clearly identified *mageto derivation of magos 'field, plain' (old irish mag 'field', breton ma 'place'), or matu 'bear', that could explain the latin translation ursalia.
nevertheless, it is also speculated that the origin of the current name of the city comes from the 2nd century bc. the roman empire established a settlement on the banks of the manzanares river. the name of this first village was matrice (a reference to the river that crossed the settlement). following the invasions carried out by the germanic sueves and vandals, as well as the sarmatic alans during the 5th century ad, the roman empire no longer had the military presence required to defend its territories on the iberian peninsula, and as a consequence, these territories were soon occupied by the vandals, who were in turn dispelled by the visigoths, who then ruled hispania in the name of the roman emperor, also taking control of matrice. in the 8th century, the islamic conquest of the iberian peninsula saw the name changed to mayrit, from the arabic term ميرا mayra (referencing water as a 'tree' or 'giver of life') and the ibero-roman suffix it that means 'place'. the modern madrid evolved from the mozarabic matrit, which is still in the madrilenian gentilic. history middle ages although the site of modern-day madrid has been occupied since prehistoric times, and there are archaeological remains of carpetani settlement, roman villas, a visigoth basilica near the church of santa maría de la almudena and three visigoth necropoleis near casa de campo, tetúan and vicálvaro, the first historical document about the existence of an established settlement in madrid dates from the muslim age. at the second half of the 9th century, emir muhammad i of córdoba built a fortress on a headland near the river manzanares, as one of the many fortresses he ordered to be built on the border between al-andalus and the kingdoms of león and castile, with the objective of protecting toledo from the christian invasions and also as a starting point for muslim offensives. after the disintegration of the caliphate of córdoba, madrid was integrated in the taifa of toledo.
with the surrender of toledo to alfonso vi of león and castile, the city was conquered by christians in 1085, and it was integrated into the kingdom of castile as a property of the crown. christians replaced muslims in the occupation of the centre of the city, while muslims and jews settled in the suburbs. the city was thriving and was given the title of villa, whose administrative district extended from the jarama in the east to the river guadarrama in the west. the government of the town was vested to the neighbouring of madrid since 1346, when king alfonso xi of castile implements the regiment, for which only the local oligarchy was taking sides in city decisions. since 1188, madrid won the right to be a city with representation in the courts of castile. in 1202, king alfonso viii of castile gave madrid its first charter to regulate the municipal council, which was expanded in 1222 by ferdinand iii of castile.
in 1309, the courts of castile were joined in madrid for the first time under ferdinand iv of castile, and later in 1329, 1339, 1391, 1393, 1419 and twice in 1435. since the unification of the kingdoms of spain under a common crown, the courts were convened in madrid more often. modern age during the revolt of the comuneros, led by juan de padilla, madrid joined the revolt against emperor charles v of germany and i of spain, but after defeat at the battle of villalar, madrid was besieged and occupied by the royal troops. however, charles i was generous to the town and gave it the titles of coronada (crowned) and imperial. when francis i of france was captured at the battle of pavia, he was imprisoned in madrid. and in the village is dated the treaty of madrid of 1526 (later denounced by the french) that resolved their situation. the number of urban inhabitants grew from 4,060 in the year 1530 to 37,500 in the year 1594. the poor population of the court was composed of ex-soldiers, foreigners, rogues and ruanes, dissatisfied with the lack of food and high prices. in june 1561, when the town had 30,000 inhabitants, philip ii of spain moved his court from valladolid to madrid, installing it in the old castle. thanks to this, the city of madrid became the political centre of the monarchy, being the capital of spain except for a short period between 1601 and 1606 (philip iii of spain's government), in which the court returned to valladolid. this fact was decisive for the evolution of the city and influenced its fate.
during the reign of philip iii and philip iv of spain, madrid saw a period of exceptional cultural brilliance, with the presence of geniuses such as miguel de cervantes, diego velázquez, francisco de quevedo and lope de vega. the death of charles ii of spain resulted in the war of the spanish succession. the city supported the claim of philip of anjou as philip v. while the city was occupied in 1706 by a portuguese army, who proclaimed king the archduke charles of austria under the name of charles iii, and again in 1710, remained loyal to philip v.
philip v built the royal palace, the royal tapestry factory and the main royal academies. but the most important bourbon was king charles iii of spain, who was known as the best mayor of madrid. charles iii took upon himself the feat of transforming madrid into a capital worthy of this category. he ordered the construction of sewers, street lighting, cemeteries outside the city, and many monuments (puerta de alcalá, cibeles fountain), and cultural institutions (el prado museum, royal botanic gardens, royal observatory, etc.). despite being known as one of the greatest benefactors of madrid, his beginnings were not entirely peaceful, as in 1766 he had to overcome the esquilache riots, a traditionalist revolt instigated by the nobility and clergy against his reformist intentions, demanding the repeal of the clothing decree ordering the shortening of the layers and the prohibition of the use of hats that hide the face, with the aim of reducing crime in the city.
the reign of charles iv of spain is not very meaningful to madrid, except for the presence of goya in the court, who portrayed the popular and courtly life of the city. from the 19th century to present day on 27 october 1807, charles iv and napoleon i signed the treaty of fontainebleau, which allowed the passage of french troops through spanish territory to join the spanish troops and invade portugal, which had refused to obey the order of international blockade against england. as this was happening, there was the mutiny of aranjuez (17 march 1808), by which the crown prince, ferdinand vii, replaced his father as king. however, when ferdinand vii returned to madrid, the city was already occupied by joachim-napoléon murat, so that both the king and his father were virtually prisoners of the french army. napoleon, taking advantage of the weakness of the spanish bourbons, forced both, first the father then the son, to join him in bayonne, where ferdinand arrived on 20 april.
in the absence of the two kings, the situation became more and more tense in the capital. on 2 may, a crowd began to gather at the royal palace. the crowd saw the french soldiers pulled out of the palace to the royal family members who were still in the palace. immediately, the crowd launched an assault on the floats. the fight lasted hours and spread throughout madrid. subsequent repression was brutal. in the paseo del prado and in the fields of la moncloa hundreds of patriots were shot due to murat's order against spanish all carrying arms. paintings such as the third of may 1808 by goya reflect the repression that ended the popular uprising on 2 may.
the peninsular war against napoleon, despite the last absolutist claims during the reign of ferdinand vii, gave birth to a new country with a liberal and bourgeois character, open to influences coming from the rest of europe. madrid, the capital of spain, experienced like no other city the changes caused by this opening and filled with theatres, cafés and newspapers. madrid was frequently altered by revolutionary outbreaks and pronouncements, such as vicálvaro 1854, led by general leopoldo o'donnell and initiating the progressive biennium. however, in the early 20th century madrid looked more like a small town than a modern city. during the first third of the 20th century the population nearly doubled, reaching more than 850,000 inhabitants. new suburbs such as las ventas, tetuán and el carmen became the homes of the influx of workers, while ensanche became a middle-class neighbourhood of madrid. the spanish constitution of 1931 was the first legislated on the state capital, setting it explicitly in madrid.
madrid was one of the most heavily affected cities of spain in the civil war (1936–1939). the city was a stronghold of the republicans from july 1936. its western suburbs were the scene of an all-out battle in november 1936 and it was during the civil war that madrid became the first european city to be bombed by aeroplanes (japan was the first to bomb civilians in world history, at shanghai in 1932) specifically targeting civilians in the history of warfare. (see siege of madrid (1936–39)).
during the economic boom in spain from 1959 to 1973, the city experienced unprecedented, extraordinary development in terms of population and wealth, becoming the largest gdp city in spain, and ranking third in western europe. the municipality was extended, annexing neighbouring council districts, to achieve the present extension of 607 km2 (234.36 sq mi). the south of madrid became very industrialised, and there were massive migrations from rural areas of spain into the city. madrid's newly built north-western districts became the home of the new thriving middle class that appeared as result of the 1960s spanish economic boom, while the south-eastern periphery became an extensive working-class settlement, which was the base for an active cultural and political reform.
after the death of franco and the start of the democratic regime, the 1978 constitution confirmed madrid as the capital of spain. in 1979, the first municipal elections brought madrid's first democratically elected mayor since the second republic. madrid was the scene of some of the most important events of the time, such as the mass demonstrations of support for democracy after the foiled coup, 23-f, on 23 february 1981. the first democratic mayors belonged to the leftist parties (enrique tierno galván, juan barranco gallardo), turning the city after more conservative positions (agustín rodríguez sahagún, josé maría Álvarez del manzano, alberto ruiz-gallardón and ana botella). benefiting from increasing prosperity in the 1980s and 1990s, the capital city of spain has consolidated its position as an important economic, cultural, industrial, educational, and technological centre on the european continent. geography madrid lies on the southern meseta central, 60 km south of the guadarrama mountains and straddling the jarama and manzanares river basins. there is a considerable difference in altitude within city limits ranging from 543 m (1,781 ft) to 846 m (2,776 ft) above sea level. over a quarter of the madrid municipal area is covered by the largely forested protected area of el pardo. climate the madrid region has an inland mediterranean climate (köppen csa) which transitions to a semi-arid climate (bsk) in the eastern side of the city. winters are cool due to its altitude which 667 m (2,188 ft) above sea level, including sporadic snowfalls and frequent frosts in january and february. summers are hot, in the warmest month – july -average temperatures during the day ranging from 32 to 33 °c (90 to 91 °f) depending on location, with maximums commonly climbing over 35 °c (95 °f) during frequent heat waves. due to madrid's altitude and dry climate, diurnal ranges are often significant during the summer. the highest recorded temperature was on 24 july 1995, at 42.2 °c (108.0 °f), and the lowest recorded temperature was on 16 january 1945 at −10.1 °c (13.8 °f). although these records were registered at the airport, in the eastern side of the city. precipitation is concentrated in the autumn and spring, and, together with athens which has similar annual precipitation, is the driest capital in europe. it is particularly sparse during the summer, taking the form of about two showers and/or thunderstorms a month. water supply madrid derives almost 73.5 percent of its water supply from dams and reservoirs built on the lozoya river, such as the el atazar dam, which was built in 1972 and inaugurated by francisco franco. this water supply is managed by canal de isabel ii, a public entity created in 1851. it is responsible for the supply, depurating waste water and the conservation of all the comunidad de madrid region natural water resources. demographics the population of madrid has overall increased since the city became the capital of spain in the mid-16th century, and has stabilised at approximately 3 million since the 1970s.
from 1970 until the mid-1990s, the population dropped. this phenomenon, which also affected other european cities, was caused in part by the growth of satellite suburbs at the expense of the downtown region within the city proper. this also occurred during a period of slowed growth in the european economy.
the demographic boom accelerated in the late 1990s and early first decade of the 21st century due to immigration in parallel with a surge in spanish economic growth. according to census data, the population of the city grew by 271,856 between 2001 and 2005. immigration as the capital city of spain, the city has attracted many immigrants from around the world. in 2015, about 89.8% of the inhabitants were spanish, while people of other origins, including immigrants from latin america, europe, asia, north africa and west africa, represented 11.2% of the population.
the ten largest immigrant groups include: ecuadorian: 104,184, romanian: 52,875, bolivian: 44,044, colombian: 35,971, peruvian: 35,083, chinese: 34,666, moroccan: 32,498, dominican: 19,602, brazilian: 14,583, and paraguayan: 14,308. there were 2,476 japanese citizens registered with the japanese embassy in madrid in 1993. there are also important communities of filipinos, equatorial guineans, uruguayans, bulgarians, greeks, indians, italians, argentines, senegalese and poles.

as with many metropolitan areas of similar size, two distinct zones of urbanisation can be distinguished:
inner ring (primera corona): alcorcón, leganés, getafe, móstoles, fuenlabrada, coslada, alcobendas, pozuelo de alarcón, san fernando de henares
outer ring (segunda corona): villaviciosa de odón, parla, pinto, valdemoro, rivas-vaciamadrid, torrejón de ardoz, alcalá de henares, san sebastián de los reyes, tres cantos, las rozas de madrid, majadahonda, boadilla del monte
the largest suburbs are to the south, and in general along the main routes leading out of madrid.
submetropolitan areas inside madrid metropolitan area: cityscape architecture very little medieval architecture is preserved in madrid, mostly in the almendra central, including the san nicolás and san pedro el viejo church towers, the church of st. jerome, and the bishop's chapel. nor has madrid retained much renaissance architecture, other than the bridge of segovia and the convent of las descalzas reales. many of the historic buildings of madrid date from the spanish golden age, which coincided with the habsburgs reign (1516–1700). philip ii moved his court to madrid in 1561 and transformed the town into a capital city. these reforms were embodied in the plaza mayor, characterised by its symmetry and austerity, as well as the new alcázar, which would become the second most impressive royal palace of the kingdom. the material used during the habsburg era was mostly brick, and the humble façades contrast with the elaborate interiors. notable buildings include the prison of the court, the palace of the councils, the royal convent of la encarnación, and the buen retiro palace. the imperial college church model dome was imitated in all of spain. pedro de ribera introduced churrigueresque architecture to madrid; the cuartel del conde-duque, the church of montserrat, and the bridge of toledo are among the best examples.
the reign of the bourbons during the eighteenth century marked a new era in the city. philip v tried to complete king philip ii's vision of urbanisation of madrid. philip v built a palace in line with french taste, as well as other buildings such as st. michael's basilica and the church of santa bárbara. king charles iii beautified the city and endeavoured to convert madrid into one of the great european capitals. he pushed forward the construction of the prado museum (originally intended as a natural science museum), the puerta de alcalá, the royal observatory, the basilica of san francisco el grande, the casa de correos in puerta del sol, the real casa de la aduana, and the general hospital (which now houses the reina sofia museum and royal conservatory of music). the paseo del prado, surrounded by gardens and decorated with neoclassical statues, is an example of urban planning. the duke of berwick ordered the construction of the liria palace. during the early 19th century, the peninsular war, the loss of viceroyalties in the americas, and continuing coups limited the city's architectural development (royal theatre, the national library of spain, the palace of the senate, and the congress). the segovia viaduct linked the royal alcázar to the southern part of town.
from the mid-19th century until the civil war, madrid modernised and built new neighbourhoods and monuments. the expansion of madrid developed under the plan castro, resulting in the neighbourhoods of salamanca, argüelles, and chamberí. arturo soria conceived the linear city and built the first few kilometres of the road that bears his name, which embodies the idea. the gran vía was built using different styles that evolved over time: french style, eclectic, art deco, and expressionist. antonio palacios built a series of buildings inspired by the viennese secession, such as the palace of communication, the fine arts circle of madrid (círculo de bellas artes), and the río de la plata bank (instituto cervantes). other notable buildings include the bank of spain, the neo-gothic almudena cathedral, atocha station, and the catalan art-nouveau palace of longoria. las ventas bullring was built, as the market of san miguel (cast-iron style). the civil war severely damaged the city. subsequently, the old town and the ensanche were destroyed, and numerous blocks of flats were built. examples of post-war architecture include the spanish air force headquarters and the skyscrapers of plaza de españa, at the time (the 1950s) the highest in europe.
with the advent of spanish economic development, skyscrapers, such as torre picasso, torres blancas and torre bbva, and the gate of europe, appeared in the late 20th century in the city. during the decade of the 2000s, the four tallest skyscrapers in spain were built and together form the cuatro torres business area. madrid-barajas airport terminal 4 was inaugurated in 2006 and won several architectural awards. terminal 4 is one of the world's largest terminal areas and features glass panes and domes in the roof, which allow natural light to pass through. urban sculpture the streets of madrid are a veritable museum of outdoor sculpture. the museum of outdoor sculpture, located in the paseo de la castellana, is dedicated to abstract works, among which is the sirena varada (strander mermaid) by eduardo chillida.
since the 18th century, the paseo del prado has been decorated with an iconographic program with classical monumental fountains: the fuente de la alcachofa (fountain of the artichoke), the cuatro fuentes (four fountains), the fuente de neptuno (fountain of neptune), the fuente de apolo (fountain of apollo), and the fuente de cibeles (fountain of cybele, also known as fountain of cibeles), all designed by ventura rodríguez.
the equestrian sculptures are particularly important, starting chronologically with two designed in the 17th century: the statue of philip iii, in the plaza mayor by giambologna, and the statue of philip iv, in the plaza de oriente (undoubtedly the most important statue of madrid, projected by velázquez and built by pietro tacca with scientific advice of galileo galilei).
many areas of the buen retiro park (parque del retiro) are really sculptural scenography: among them are the fallen angel by ricardo bellver and the monument to alfonso xii, designed by josé grases riera.
in another vein are the neon advertising signs, some of which have acquired a historic range and are legally protected, such as schweppes in plaza de callao or tío pepe in the puerta del sol, recently retired from its location for the restoration of the building. environment madrid is the european city with the highest number of trees and green surface per inhabitant and it has the second highest number of aligned trees in the world, with 248,000 units, only exceeded by tokyo. madrid's citizens have access to a green area within a 15-minute walk. since 1997, green areas have increased by 16%. at present, 8.2% of madrid's grounds are green areas, meaning that there are 16 m2 (172 sq ft) of green area per inhabitant, far exceeding the 10 m2 (108 sq ft) per inhabitant recommended by the world health organization. buen retiro park (parque del buen retiro, or simply parque del retiro), formerly the grounds of the palace built for philip iv of spain, is madrid's most popular park and the largest park in central madrid. its area is more than 1.4 km2 (0.5 sq mi) (350 acres) and it is located very close to the puerta de alcalá and not far from the prado museum. the park is entirely surrounded by the present-day city. its lake in the middle once staged mini naval sham battles to amuse royalty; these days the more tranquil pastime of pleasure boating is popular. inspired by london's crystal palace, the palacio de cristal can be found at the south-eastern end of the park.
in the buen retiro park is also the forest of the departed (bosque de los ausentes), a memorial monument to commemorate the 191 victims of the 11 march 2004 madrid attacks.
atocha railway station (estación de atocha) is the city's first and most central station, and is also home to a 4,000-square-metre (43,056-square-foot) indoor garden, with more than 500 species of plant life and ponds with turtles and goldfish in. casa de campo is an enormous urban parkland to the west of the city, the largest in spain and madrid's main green lung. its area is more than 1,700 hectares (6.6 sq mi). it is home to a fairground, the madrid zoo, an amusement park, the parque de atracciones de madrid, and an outdoor municipal pool, to enjoy a bird's eye view of the park and city take a cable car trip above the tree tops. casa de campo's vegetation is one of its most important features. there are, in fact, three different ecosystems: oak, pine and river groves. the oak is the dominant tree species in the area and, although many of them are over 100 years old and reach a great height, they are also present in the form of chaparral and bushes. the pine-forest ecosystem boasts a large number of trees that have adapted perfectly to the light, dry conditions in the park. in addition, mushrooms often emerge after the first rains of autumn. finally, the river groves, or riparian forests, are made up of various, mainly deciduous, species that grow in wetter areas. examples include poplars, willows and alder trees. as regards fauna, this green space is home to approximately 133 vertebrate species.
the royal botanical garden of madrid (real jardín botánico de madrid) is an 8-hectare botanical garden located in the plaza de murillo, next to the prado museum. it was an 18th-century creation by carlos iii and it was used as a base for the plant species being collected across the globe. there is an important research facility that started life as a base to develop herbal remedies and to house the species collected from the new-world trips, today it is dedicated to maintaining europe's ecosystem. the royal palace (palacio real) is surrounded by three green areas. in front of the palace, are the gardens of the plaza de oriente; to the north, the gardens of sabatini and to the west up to the manzanares river, the famous campo del moro. campo del moro gardens has a surface area of 20 hectares and is a scenic garden with an unusual layout filled with foliage and an air of english romanticism. the sabatini gardens have a formal neoclassic style, consisting of well-trimmed hedges, in symmetric geometrical patterns, adorned with a pool, statues and fountains, with trees also planted in a symmetrical geometric shape. plaza de oriente can distinguish three main plots: the central gardens, the cabo noval gardens and the lepanto gardens. the central gardens are arranged around the central monument to philip iv, in a grid, following the barroque model garden. they consist of seven flowerbeds, each packed with box hedges, forms of cypress, yew and magnolia of small size, and flower plantations, temporary. these are bounded on either side by rows of statues paths, popularly known as the gothic kings, and mark the dividing line between the main body of the plaza and the cabo noval gardens at north, and the lepanto gardens at south. mount of el pardo (monte de el pardo) is a mediterranean forest inside the city of madrid. it is one of the best preserved mediterranean forests in europe. the european union has designated the monte de el pardo as a special protection area for bird-life. this meadow, which has been used as hunting grounds by the royalty given the variety of game animals that have inhabited it since the middle ages, is home to 120 flora species and 200 vertebrae species. rabbits, red partridges, wild cats, stags, deer and wild boars live among ilexes, cork oaks, ash trees, black poplars, oaks, junipers and rockroses. monte del pardo is part of the regional park of the high basin of the manzanares, spreading out from the guadarrama mountains range to the centre of madrid, and protected by strong legal regulations. just before crossing the city, the river manzanares forms a valley composed by sandy elements and detritus from the mountain range. soto de viñuelas, also known as mount viñuelas, is a meadow-oak forest north of the city of madrid and east of the monte de el pardo. it is a fenced property of about 3,000 hectares, which includes important ecological values, landscape and art. soto de viñuelas is part of the regional park of the high basin of the manzanares, a nature reserve which is recognised as a biosphere reserve by unesco, where it has been classified as area b, the legal instrument that allows agricultural land use. soto de viñuelas has also received the statement of special protection area for birds. el capricho is a 14-hectare garden located in the area of barajas district. it dates back to 1784. the art of landscaping in el capricho is displayed in three different styles of classical gardenscapes: the parterre or french garden, english landscaping and the italian giardino.

a large industrial sector did not develop until the 20th century, but thereafter industry greatly expanded and diversified, making madrid the second industrial city in spain. however, the economy of the city is now becoming more and more dominated by the service sector.
madrid is the 5th most important leading center of commerce in europe (after london, paris, frankfurt and amsterdam) and ranks 11th in the world. economic history as the capital city of the spanish empire from 1561, madrid's population grew rapidly. administration, banking, and small-scale manufacturing centred on the royal court were among the main activities, but the city was more a locus of consumption than production or trade, geographically isolated as it was before the coming of the railways.
industry started to develop on a large scale only in the 20th century, but then grew rapidly, especially during the spanish miracle period around the 1960s. the economy of the city was then centred on diverse manufacturing industries such as those related to motor vehicles, aircraft, chemicals, electronic devices, pharmaceuticals, processed food, printed materials, and leather goods. since the restoration of democracy in the late 1970s, the city has continued to expand. its economy is now among the most dynamic and diverse in the european union. present-day economy as the national capital, madrid concentrates activities directly connected with power (central and regional government, headquarters of spanish companies, regional hq of multinationals, financial institutions) and with knowledge and technological innovation (research centres and universities). it is one of europe's largest financial centres and the largest in spain. the city has 17 universities and over 30 research centres. it is the third metropolis in the eu by population, and the fourth by gross internal product. leading employers include telefónica, iberia, prosegur, bbva, urbaser, dragados, and fcc.

the economy of madrid has become based increasingly on the service sector. in 2011 services accounted for 85.9% of value added, while industry contributed 7.9% and construction 6.1%. nevertheless, madrid continues to hold the position of spain's second industrial centre after barcelona, specialising particularly in high-technology production. following the recession, services and industry were forecast to return to growth in 2014, and construction in 2015. standard of living mean household income and spending are 12% above the spanish average. the proportion classified as at risk of poverty in 2010 was 15.6%, up from 13.0% in 2006 but less than the average for spain of 21.8%. the proportion classified as affluent was 43.3%, much higher than spain overall (28.6%).
consumption by madrid residents has been affected by job losses and by austerity measures, including a rise in sales tax from 8% to 21% in 2012.
although residential property prices have fallen by 39% since 2007, the average price of dwelling space was €2,375.6 per sq. m. in early 2014, and is shown as second only to london in a list of 22 european cities. employment participation in the labour force was 1,638,200 in 2011, or 79.0%. the employed workforce comprised 49% women in 2011 (spain, 45%). 41% of economically active people are university graduates, against 24% for spain as a whole. in 2011, the unemployment rate was 15.8%, remaining lower than in spain as a whole. among those aged 16–24, the unemployment rate was 39.6%. unemployment reached a peak of 19.1% in 2013, but with the start of an economic recovery in 2014, employment started to increase. employment continues to shift further towards the service sector, with 86% of all jobs in this sector by 2011, against 74% in all of spain. services the share of services in the city’s economy is 86%. services to business, transport & communications, property & financial together account for 52% of total value added. the types of services that are now expanding are mainly those that facilitate movement of capital, information, goods and persons, and advanced business services such as research and development (r&d), information technology, and technical accountancy.

the construction of transport infrastructure has been vital to maintain the economic position of madrid. travel to work and other local journeys use a high-capacity metropolitan road network and a well-used public transport system. in terms of longer-distance transport, madrid is the central node of the system of autovías and of the high-speed rail network (ave), which has brought major cities such as seville and barcelona within 2.5 hours travel time. also important to the city's economy is madrid-barajas airport, the fourth largest airport in europe. madrid’s central location makes it a major logistical base. industry as an industrial centre madrid retains its advantages in infrastructure, as a transport hub, and as the location of headquarters of many companies. industries based on advanced technology are acquiring much more importance here than in the rest of spain. industry contributed 7.5% to madrid's value-added in 2010. however, industry has slowly declined within the city boundaries as more industry has moved outward to the periphery. industrial gross value added grew by 4.3% in the period 2003–2005, but decreased by 10% during 2008–2010. the leading industries were: paper, printing & publishing, 28.8%; energy & mining, 19.7%; vehicles & transport equipment, 12.9%; electrical and electronic, 10.3%; foodstuffs, 9.6%; clothing, footwear & textiles, 8.3%; chemical, 7.9%; industrial machinery, 7.3%. construction the construction sector, contributing 6.5% to the city’s economy in 2010, was a growing sector before the recession, aided by a large transport and infrastructure program. more recently the construction sector has fallen away and earned 8% less in 2009 than it had been in 2000. the decrease was particularly marked in the residential sector, where prices dropped by 25%–27% from 2007 to 2012/13 and the number of sales fell by 57%. international rankings a recent study placed madrid 7th among 36 cities as an attractive base for business. it was placed third in terms of availability of office space, and fifth for easy of access to markets, availability of qualified staff, mobility within the city, and quality of life. its less favourable characteristics were seen as pollution, languages spoken, and political environment. another ranking of european cities placed madrid 5th among 25 cities (behind berlin, london, paris and frankfurt), being rated favourably on economic factors and the labour market, and on transport and communication. art and culture museums and art centres madrid is considered one of the top european destinations concerning art museums. best known is the golden triangle of art, located along the paseo del prado and comprising three museums. the most famous one is the prado museum, known for such highlights as diego velázquez's las meninas and francisco de goya's la maja vestida and la maja desnuda. the other two museums are the thyssen bornemisza museum, established from a mixed private collection, and the reina sofía museum, where pablo picasso's guernica hangs, returned to spain from new york after more than two decades.

the internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the internet protocol suite (tcp/ip) to link devices worldwide. it is a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. the internet carries an unlimited range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the world wide web (www), electronic mail, telephony, and file sharing.
the origins of the internet date back to research commissioned by the united states federal government in the 1960s to build robust, fault-tolerant communication via computer networks. the linking of commercial networks and enterprises in the early 1990s marked the beginning of the transition to the modern internet, and generated rapid growth as institutional, personal, and mobile computers were connected to the network. by the late 2000s, its services and technologies had been incorporated into virtually every aspect of modern life.
most traditional communications media, including telephony, radio, television, paper mail and newspapers are being reshaped, redefined, or even bypassed by the internet, giving birth to new services such as email, internet telephony, internet television, online music, digital newspapers, and video streaming websites. newspaper, book, and other print publishing are adapting to website technology, or are reshaped into blogging, web feeds and online news aggregators. the internet has enabled and accelerated new forms of personal interactions through instant messaging, internet forums, and social networking. online shopping has grown exponentially both for major retailers and small businesses and entrepreneurs, as it enables firms to extend their brick and mortar presence to serve a larger market or even sell goods and services entirely online. business-to-business and financial services on the internet affect supply chains across entire industries.
the internet has no centralized governance in either technological implementation or policies for access and usage; each constituent network sets its own policies. only the overreaching definitions of the two principal name spaces in the internet, the internet protocol address (ip address) space and the domain name system (dns), are directed by a maintainer organization, the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers (icann). the technical underpinning and standardization of the core protocols is an activity of the internet engineering task force (ietf), a non-profit organization of loosely affiliated international participants that anyone may associate with by contributing technical expertise. terminology when the term internet is used to refer to the specific global system of interconnected internet protocol (ip) networks, the word is a proper noun that should be written with an initial capital letter. in common use and the media, it is often erroneously not capitalized, viz. the internet. some guides specify that the word should be capitalized when used as a noun, but not capitalized when used as an adjective. the internet is also often referred to as the net, as a short form of network. historically, as early as 1849, the word internetted was used uncapitalized as an adjective, meaning interconnected or interwoven. the designers of early computer networks used internet both as a noun and as a verb in shorthand form of internetwork or internetworking, meaning interconnecting computer networks.
the terms internet and world wide web are often used interchangeably in everyday speech; it is common to speak of going on the internet when using a web browser to view web pages. however, the world wide web or the web is only one of a large number of internet services. the web is a collection of interconnected documents (web pages) and other web resources, linked by hyperlinks and urls. as another point of comparison, hypertext transfer protocol, or http, is the language used on the web for information transfer, yet it is just one of many languages or protocols that can be used for communication on the internet. the term interweb is a portmanteau of internet and world wide web typically used sarcastically to parody a technically unsavvy user. history research into packet switching by paul baran and donald davies emerged in the early to mid-1960s, and packet switched networks such as the npl network, arpanet, tymnet, the merit network, telenet, and cyclades, were developed in the late 1960s and 1970s using a variety of protocols. the arpanet project led to the development of protocols for internetworking, by which multiple separate networks could be joined into a single network of networks. arpanet development began with two network nodes which were interconnected between the network measurement center at the university of california, los angeles (ucla) henry samueli school of engineering and applied science directed by leonard kleinrock, and the nls system at sri international (sri) by douglas engelbart in menlo park, california, on 29 october 1969. the third site was the culler-fried interactive mathematics center at the university of california, santa barbara, followed by the university of utah graphics department. in an early sign of future growth, fifteen sites were connected to the young arpanet by the end of 1971. these early years were documented in the 1972 film computer networks: the heralds of resource sharing.
early international collaborations on the arpanet were rare. european developers were concerned with developing the x.25 networks. notable exceptions were the norwegian seismic array (norsar) in june 1973, followed in 1973 by sweden with satellite links to the tanum earth station and peter t. kirstein's research group in the united kingdom, initially at the institute of computer science, university of london and later at university college london. in december 1974, rfc 675 (specification of internet transmission control program), by vinton cerf, yogen dalal, and carl sunshine, used the term internet as a shorthand for internetworking and later rfcs repeated this use. access to the arpanet was expanded in 1981 when the national science foundation (nsf) funded the computer science network (csnet). in 1982, the internet protocol suite (tcp/ip) was standardized, which permitted worldwide proliferation of interconnected networks. tcp/ip network access expanded again in 1986 when the national science foundation network (nsfnet) provided access to supercomputer sites in the united states for researchers, first at speeds of 56 kbit/s and later at 1.5 mbit/s and 45 mbit/s. commercial internet service providers (isps) emerged in the late 1980s and early 1990s. the arpanet was decommissioned in 1990. by 1995, the internet was fully commercialized in the u.s. when the nsfnet was decommissioned, removing the last restrictions on use of the internet to carry commercial traffic. the internet rapidly expanded in europe and australia in the mid to late 1980s and to asia in the late 1980s and early 1990s. the beginning of dedicated transatlantic communication between the nsfnet and networks in europe was established with a low-speed satellite relay between princeton university and stockholm, sweden in december 1988. although other network protocols such as uucp had global reach well before this time, this marked the beginning of the internet as an intercontinental network.
public commercial use of the internet began in mid-1989 with the connection of mci mail and compuserve's email capabilities to the 500,000 users of the internet. just months later on 1 january 1990, psinet launched an alternate internet backbone for commercial use; one of the networks that would grow into the commercial internet we know today. in march 1990, the first high-speed t1 (1.5 mbit/s) link between the nsfnet and europe was installed between cornell university and cern, allowing much more robust communications than were capable with satellites. six months later tim berners-lee would begin writing worldwideweb, the first web browser after two years of lobbying cern management. by christmas 1990, berners-lee had built all the tools necessary for a working web: the hypertext transfer protocol (http) 0.9, the hypertext markup language (html), the first web browser (which was also a html editor and could access usenet newsgroups and ftp files), the first http server software (later known as cern httpd), the first web server, and the first web pages that described the project itself. in 1991 the commercial internet exchange was founded, allowing psinet to communicate with the other commercial networks cerfnet and alternet. since 1995 the internet has tremendously impacted culture and commerce, including the rise of near instant communication by email, instant messaging, telephony (voice over internet protocol or voip), two-way interactive video calls, and the world wide web with its discussion forums, blogs, social networking, and online shopping sites. increasing amounts of data are transmitted at higher and higher speeds over fiber optic networks operating at 1-gbit/s, 10-gbit/s, or more.
the internet continues to grow, driven by ever greater amounts of online information and knowledge, commerce, entertainment and social networking. during the late 1990s, it was estimated that traffic on the public internet grew by 100 percent per year, while the mean annual growth in the number of internet users was thought to be between 20% and 50%. this growth is often attributed to the lack of central administration, which allows organic growth of the network, as well as the non-proprietary nature of the internet protocols, which encourages vendor interoperability and prevents any one company from exerting too much control over the network. as of 31 march 2011, the estimated total number of internet users was 2.095 billion (30.2% of world population). it is estimated that in 1993 the internet carried only 1% of the information flowing through two-way telecommunication, by 2000 this figure had grown to 51%, and by 2007 more than 97% of all telecommunicated information was carried over the internet. governance the internet is a global network that comprises many voluntarily interconnected autonomous networks. it operates without a central governing body. the technical underpinning and standardization of the core protocols (ipv4 and ipv6) is an activity of the internet engineering task force (ietf), a non-profit organization of loosely affiliated international participants that anyone may associate with by contributing technical expertise. to maintain interoperability, the principal name spaces of the internet are administered by the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers (icann). icann is governed by an international board of directors drawn from across the internet technical, business, academic, and other non-commercial communities. icann coordinates the assignment of unique identifiers for use on the internet, including domain names, internet protocol (ip) addresses, application port numbers in the transport protocols, and many other parameters. globally unified name spaces are essential for maintaining the global reach of the internet. this role of icann distinguishes it as perhaps the only central coordinating body for the global internet.
regional internet registries (rirs) allocate ip addresses:
african network information center (afrinic) for africa
american registry for internet numbers (arin) for north america
asia-pacific network information centre (apnic) for asia and the pacific region
latin american and caribbean internet addresses registry (lacnic) for latin america and the caribbean region
réseaux ip européens – network coordination centre (ripe ncc) for europe, the middle east, and central asia
the national telecommunications and information administration, an agency of the united states department of commerce, had final approval over changes to the dns root zone until the iana stewardship transition on 1 october 2016. the internet society (isoc) was founded in 1992 with a mission to assure the open development, evolution and use of the internet for the benefit of all people throughout the world. its members include individuals (anyone may join) as well as corporations, organizations, governments, and universities. among other activities isoc provides an administrative home for a number of less formally organized groups that are involved in developing and managing the internet, including: the internet engineering task force (ietf), internet architecture board (iab), internet engineering steering group (iesg), internet research task force (irtf), and internet research steering group (irsg). on 16 november 2005, the united nations-sponsored world summit on the information society in tunis established the internet governance forum (igf) to discuss internet-related issues. infrastructure the communications infrastructure of the internet consists of its hardware components and a system of software layers that control various aspects of the architecture. routing and service tiers internet service providers establish the worldwide connectivity between individual networks at various levels of scope. end-users who only access the internet when needed to perform a function or obtain information, represent the bottom of the routing hierarchy. at the top of the routing hierarchy are the tier 1 networks, large telecommunication companies that exchange traffic directly with each other via peering agreements. tier 2 and lower level networks buy internet transit from other providers to reach at least some parties on the global internet, though they may also engage in peering. an isp may use a single upstream provider for connectivity, or implement multihoming to achieve redundancy and load balancing. internet exchange points are major traffic exchanges with physical connections to multiple isps. large organizations, such as academic institutions, large enterprises, and governments, may perform the same function as isps, engaging in peering and purchasing transit on behalf of their internal networks. research networks tend to interconnect with large subnetworks such as geant, gloriad, internet2, and the uk's national research and education network, janet. both the internet ip routing structure and hypertext links of the world wide web are examples of scale-free networks. computers and routers use routing tables in their operating system to direct ip packets to the next-hop router or destination. routing tables are maintained by manual configuration or automatically by routing protocols. end-nodes typically use a default route that points toward an isp providing transit, while isp routers use the border gateway protocol to establish the most efficient routing across the complex connections of the global internet. access common methods of internet access by users include dial-up with a computer modem via telephone circuits, broadband over coaxial cable, fiber optics or copper wires, wi-fi, satellite and cellular telephone technology (3g, 4g). the internet may often be accessed from computers in libraries and internet cafes. internet access points exist in many public places such as airport halls and coffee shops. various terms are used, such as public internet kiosk, public access terminal, and web payphone. many hotels also have public terminals, though these are usually fee-based. these terminals are widely accessed for various usages, such as ticket booking, bank deposit, or online payment. wi-fi provides wireless access to the internet via local computer networks. hotspots providing such access include wi-fi cafes, where users need to bring their own wireless devices such as a laptop or pda. these services may be free to all, free to customers only, or fee-based.
grassroots efforts have led to wireless community networks. commercial wi-fi services covering large city areas are in place in new york, london, vienna, toronto, san francisco, philadelphia, chicago and pittsburgh. the internet can then be accessed from such places as a park bench. apart from wi-fi, there have been experiments with proprietary mobile wireless networks like ricochet, various high-speed data services over cellular phone networks, and fixed wireless services. high-end mobile phones such as smartphones in general come with internet access through the phone network. web browsers such as opera are available on these advanced handsets, which can also run a wide variety of other internet software. more mobile phones have internet access than pcs, though this is not as widely used. an internet access provider and protocol matrix differentiates the methods used to get online. protocols while the hardware components in the internet infrastructure can often be used to support other software systems, it is the design and the standardization process of the software that characterizes the internet and provides the foundation for its scalability and success. the responsibility for the architectural design of the internet software systems has been assumed by the internet engineering task force (ietf). the ietf conducts standard-setting work groups, open to any individual, about the various aspects of internet architecture. resulting contributions and standards are published as request for comments (rfc) documents on the ietf web site. the principal methods of networking that enable the internet are contained in specially designated rfcs that constitute the internet standards. other less rigorous documents are simply informative, experimental, or historical, or document the best current practices (bcp) when implementing internet technologies.
the internet standards describe a framework known as the internet protocol suite. this is a model architecture that divides methods into a layered system of protocols, originally documented in rfc 1122 and rfc 1123. the layers correspond to the environment or scope in which their services operate. at the top is the application layer, space for the application-specific networking methods used in software applications. for example, a web browser program uses the client-server application model and a specific protocol of interaction between servers and clients, while many file-sharing systems use a peer-to-peer paradigm. below this top layer, the transport layer connects applications on different hosts with a logical channel through the network with appropriate data exchange methods.
underlying these layers are the networking technologies that interconnect networks at their borders and exchange traffic across them. the internet layer enables computers to identify and locate each other via internet protocol (ip) addresses, and routes their traffic via intermediate (transit) networks. last, at the bottom of the architecture is the link layer, which provides logical connectivity between hosts on the same network link, such as a local area network (lan) or a dial-up connection. the model, also known as tcp/ip, is designed to be independent of the underlying hardware used for the physical connections, which the model does not concern itself with in any detail. other models have been developed, such as the osi model, that attempt to be comprehensive in every aspect of communications. while many similarities exist between the models, they are not compatible in the details of description or implementation. yet, tcp/ip protocols are usually included in the discussion of osi networking. the most prominent component of the internet model is the internet protocol (ip), which provides addressing systems, including ip addresses, for computers on the network. ip enables internetworking and, in essence, establishes the internet itself. internet protocol version 4 (ipv4) is the initial version used on the first generation of the internet and is still in dominant use. it was designed to address up to ~4.3 billion (109) hosts. however, the explosive growth of the internet has led to ipv4 address exhaustion, which entered its final stage in 2011, when the global address allocation pool was exhausted. a new protocol version, ipv6, was developed in the mid-1990s, which provides vastly larger addressing capabilities and more efficient routing of internet traffic. ipv6 is currently in growing deployment around the world, since internet address registries (rirs) began to urge all resource managers to plan rapid adoption and conversion.
ipv6 is not directly interoperable by design with ipv4. in essence, it establishes a parallel version of the internet not directly accessible with ipv4 software. thus, translation facilities must exist for internetworking or nodes must have duplicate networking software for both networks. essentially all modern computer operating systems support both versions of the internet protocol. network infrastructure, however, has been lagging in this development. aside from the complex array of physical connections that make up its infrastructure, the internet is facilitated by bi- or multi-lateral commercial contracts, e.g., peering agreements, and by technical specifications or protocols that describe the exchange of data over the network. indeed, the internet is defined by its interconnections and routing policies. services the internet carries many network services, most prominently mobile apps such as social media apps, the world wide web, electronic mail, multiplayer online games, internet telephony, and file sharing services. world wide web many people use the terms internet and world wide web, or just the web, interchangeably, but the two terms are not synonymous. the world wide web is the primary application program that billions of people use on the internet, and it has changed their lives immeasurably. however, the internet provides many other services. the web is a global set of documents, images and other resources, logically interrelated by hyperlinks and referenced with uniform resource identifiers (uris). uris symbolically identify services, servers, and other databases, and the documents and resources that they can provide. hypertext transfer protocol (http) is the main access protocol of the world wide web. web services also use http to allow software systems to communicate in order to share and exchange business logic and data.
world wide web browser software, such as microsoft's internet explorer/edge, mozilla firefox, opera, apple's safari, and google chrome, lets users navigate from one web page to another via hyperlinks embedded in the documents. these documents may also contain any combination of computer data, including graphics, sounds, text, video, multimedia and interactive content that runs while the user is interacting with the page. client-side software can include animations, games, office applications and scientific demonstrations. through keyword-driven internet research using search engines like yahoo!, bing and google, users worldwide have easy, instant access to a vast and diverse amount of online information. compared to printed media, books, encyclopedias and traditional libraries, the world wide web has enabled the decentralization of information on a large scale.
the web has also enabled individuals and organizations to publish ideas and information to a potentially large audience online at greatly reduced expense and time delay. publishing a web page, a blog, or building a website involves little initial cost and many cost-free services are available. however, publishing and maintaining large, professional web sites with attractive, diverse and up-to-date information is still a difficult and expensive proposition. many individuals and some companies and groups use web logs or blogs, which are largely used as easily updatable online diaries. some commercial organizations encourage staff to communicate advice in their areas of specialization in the hope that visitors will be impressed by the expert knowledge and free information, and be attracted to the corporation as a result.
one example of this practice is microsoft, whose product developers publish their personal blogs in order to pique the public's interest in their work. collections of personal web pages published by large service providers remain popular and have become increasingly sophisticated. whereas operations such as angelfire and geocities have existed since the early days of the web, newer offerings from, for example, facebook and twitter currently have large followings. these operations often brand themselves as social network services rather than simply as web page hosts.
advertising on popular web pages can be lucrative, and e-commerce, which is the sale of products and services directly via the web, continues to grow. online advertising is a form of marketing and advertising which uses the internet to deliver promotional marketing messages to consumers. it includes email marketing, search engine marketing (sem), social media marketing, many types of display advertising (including web banner advertising), and mobile advertising. in 2011, internet advertising revenues in the united states surpassed those of cable television and nearly exceeded those of broadcast television. many common online advertising practices are controversial and increasingly subject to regulation.
when the web developed in the 1990s, a typical web page was stored in completed form on a web server, formatted in html, complete for transmission to a web browser in response to a request. over time, the process of creating and serving web pages has become dynamic, creating a flexible design, layout, and content. websites are often created using content management software with, initially, very little content. contributors to these systems, who may be paid staff, members of an organization or the public, fill underlying databases with content using editing pages designed for that purpose while casual visitors view and read this content in html form. there may or may not be editorial, approval and security systems built into the process of taking newly entered content and making it available to the target visitors. communication email is an important communications service available on the internet. the concept of sending electronic text messages between parties in a way analogous to mailing letters or memos predates the creation of the internet. pictures, documents, and other files are sent as email attachments. emails can be cc-ed to multiple email addresses.
internet telephony is another common communications service made possible by the creation of the internet. voip stands for voice-over-internet protocol, referring to the protocol that underlies all internet communication. the idea began in the early 1990s with walkie-talkie-like voice applications for personal computers. in recent years many voip systems have become as easy to use and as convenient as a normal telephone. the benefit is that, as the internet carries the voice traffic, voip can be free or cost much less than a traditional telephone call, especially over long distances and especially for those with always-on internet connections such as cable or adsl. voip is maturing into a competitive alternative to traditional telephone service. interoperability between different providers has improved and the ability to call or receive a call from a traditional telephone is available. simple, inexpensive voip network adapters are available that eliminate the need for a personal computer.
voice quality can still vary from call to call, but is often equal to and can even exceed that of traditional calls. remaining problems for voip include emergency telephone number dialing and reliability. currently, a few voip providers provide an emergency service, but it is not universally available. older traditional phones with no extra features may be line-powered only and operate during a power failure; voip can never do so without a backup power source for the phone equipment and the internet access devices. voip has also become increasingly popular for gaming applications, as a form of communication between players. popular voip clients for gaming include ventrilo and teamspeak. modern video game consoles also offer voip chat features. data transfer file sharing is an example of transferring large amounts of data across the internet. a computer file can be emailed to customers, colleagues and friends as an attachment. it can be uploaded to a website or file transfer protocol (ftp) server for easy download by others. it can be put into a shared location or onto a file server for instant use by colleagues. the load of bulk downloads to many users can be eased by the use of mirror servers or peer-to-peer networks. in any of these cases, access to the file may be controlled by user authentication, the transit of the file over the internet may be obscured by encryption, and money may change hands for access to the file. the price can be paid by the remote charging of funds from, for example, a credit card whose details are also passed – usually fully encrypted – across the internet. the origin and authenticity of the file received may be checked by digital signatures or by md5 or other message digests. these simple features of the internet, over a worldwide basis, are changing the production, sale, and distribution of anything that can be reduced to a computer file for transmission. this includes all manner of print publications, software products, news, music, film, video, photography, graphics and the other arts. this in turn has caused seismic shifts in each of the existing industries that previously controlled the production and distribution of these products.
streaming media is the real-time delivery of digital media for the immediate consumption or enjoyment by end users. many radio and television broadcasters provide internet feeds of their live audio and video productions. they may also allow time-shift viewing or listening such as preview, classic clips and listen again features. these providers have been joined by a range of pure internet broadcasters who never had on-air licenses. this means that an internet-connected device, such as a computer or something more specific, can be used to access on-line media in much the same way as was previously possible only with a television or radio receiver. the range of available types of content is much wider, from specialized technical webcasts to on-demand popular multimedia services. podcasting is a variation on this theme, where – usually audio – material is downloaded and played back on a computer or shifted to a portable media player to be listened to on the move. these techniques using simple equipment allow anybody, with little censorship or licensing control, to broadcast audio-visual material worldwide.
digital media streaming increases the demand for network bandwidth. for example, standard image quality needs 1 mbit/s link speed for sd 480p, hd 720p quality requires 2.5 mbit/s, and the top-of-the-line hdx quality needs 4.5 mbit/s for 1080p.
webcams are a low-cost extension of this phenomenon. while some webcams can give full-frame-rate video, the picture either is usually small or updates slowly. internet users can watch animals around an african waterhole, ships in the panama canal, traffic at a local roundabout or monitor their own premises, live and in real time. video chat rooms and video conferencing are also popular with many uses being found for personal webcams, with and without two-way sound. youtube was founded on 15 february 2005 and is now the leading website for free streaming video with a vast number of users. it uses a flash-based web player to stream and show video files. registered users may upload an unlimited amount of video and build their own personal profile. youtube claims that its users watch hundreds of millions, and upload hundreds of thousands of videos daily. currently, youtube also uses an html5 player. social impact the internet has enabled new forms of social interaction, activities, and social associations. this phenomenon has given rise to the scholarly study of the sociology of the internet. users internet usage has seen tremendous growth. from 2000 to 2009, the number of internet users globally rose from 394 million to 1.858 billion. by 2010, 22 percent of the world's population had access to computers with 1 billion google searches every day, 300 million internet users reading blogs, and 2 billion videos viewed daily on youtube. in 2014 the world's internet users surpassed 3 billion or 43.6 percent of world population, but two-thirds of the users came from richest countries, with 78.0 percent of europe countries population using the internet, followed by 57.4 percent of the americas.
the prevalent language for communication on the internet has been english. this may be a result of the origin of the internet, as well as the language's role as a lingua franca. early computer systems were limited to the characters in the american standard code for information interchange (ascii), a subset of the latin alphabet.
after english (27%), the most requested languages on the world wide web are chinese (25%), spanish (8%), japanese (5%), portuguese and german (4% each), arabic, french and russian (3% each), and korean (2%). by region, 42% of the world's internet users are based in asia, 24% in europe, 14% in north america, 10% in latin america and the caribbean taken together, 6% in africa, 3% in the middle east and 1% in australia/oceania. the internet's technologies have developed enough in recent years, especially in the use of unicode, that good facilities are available for development and communication in the world's widely used languages. however, some glitches such as mojibake (incorrect display of some languages' characters) still remain.
in an american study in 2005, the percentage of men using the internet was very slightly ahead of the percentage of women, although this difference reversed in those under 30. men logged on more often, spent more time online, and were more likely to be broadband users, whereas women tended to make more use of opportunities to communicate (such as email). men were more likely to use the internet to pay bills, participate in auctions, and for recreation such as downloading music and videos. men and women were equally likely to use the internet for shopping and banking. more recent studies indicate that in 2008, women significantly outnumbered men on most social networking sites, such as facebook and myspace, although the ratios varied with age. in addition, women watched more streaming content, whereas men downloaded more. in terms of blogs, men were more likely to blog in the first place; among those who blog, men were more likely to have a professional blog, whereas women were more likely to have a personal blog.
according to forecasts by euromonitor international, 44% of the world's population will be users of the internet by 2020. splitting by country, in 2012 iceland, norway, sweden, the netherlands, and denmark had the highest internet penetration by the number of users, with 93% or more of the population with access.
several neologisms exist that refer to internet users: netizen (as in as in citizen of the net) refers to those actively involved in improving online communities, the internet in general or surrounding political affairs and rights such as free speech, internaut refers to operators or technically highly capable users of the internet, digital citizen refers to a person using the internet in order to engage in society, politics, and government participation. usage the internet allows greater flexibility in working hours and location, especially with the spread of unmetered high-speed connections. the internet can be accessed almost anywhere by numerous means, including through mobile internet devices. mobile phones, datacards, handheld game consoles and cellular routers allow users to connect to the internet wirelessly. within the limitations imposed by small screens and other limited facilities of such pocket-sized devices, the services of the internet, including email and the web, may be available. service providers may restrict the services offered and mobile data charges may be significantly higher than other access methods.
educational material at all levels from pre-school to post-doctoral is available from websites. examples range from cbeebies, through school and high-school revision guides and virtual universities, to access to top-end scholarly literature through the likes of google scholar. for distance education, help with homework and other assignments, self-guided learning, whiling away spare time, or just looking up more detail on an interesting fact, it has never been easier for people to access educational information at any level from anywhere. the internet in general and the world wide web in particular are important enablers of both formal and informal education. further, the internet allows universities, in particular, researchers from the social and behavioral sciences, to conduct research remotely via virtual laboratories, with profound changes in reach and generalizability of findings as well as in communication between scientists and in the publication of results.
the low cost and nearly instantaneous sharing of ideas, knowledge, and skills have made collaborative work dramatically easier, with the help of collaborative software. not only can a group cheaply communicate and share ideas but the wide reach of the internet allows such groups more easily to form. an example of this is the free software movement, which has produced, among other things, linux, mozilla firefox, and openoffice.org (later forked into libreoffice). internet chat, whether using an irc chat room, an instant messaging system, or a social networking website, allows colleagues to stay in touch in a very convenient way while working at their computers during the day. messages can be exchanged even more quickly and conveniently than via email. these systems may allow files to be exchanged, drawings and images to be shared, or voice and video contact between team members.
content management systems allow collaborating teams to work on shared sets of documents simultaneously without accidentally destroying each other's work. business and project teams can share calendars as well as documents and other information. such collaboration occurs in a wide variety of areas including scientific research, software development, conference planning, political activism and creative writing. social and political collaboration is also becoming more widespread as both internet access and computer literacy spread.
the internet allows computer users to remotely access other computers and information stores easily from any access point. access may be with computer security, i.e. authentication and encryption technologies, depending on the requirements. this is encouraging new ways of working from home, collaboration and information sharing in many industries. an accountant sitting at home can audit the books of a company based in another country, on a server situated in a third country that is remotely maintained by it specialists in a fourth. these accounts could have been created by home-working bookkeepers, in other remote locations, based on information emailed to them from offices all over the world. some of these things were possible before the widespread use of the internet, but the cost of private leased lines would have made many of them infeasible in practice. an office worker away from their desk, perhaps on the other side of the world on a business trip or a holiday, can access their emails, access their data using cloud computing, or open a remote desktop session into their office pc using a secure virtual private network (vpn) connection on the internet. this can give the worker complete access to all of their normal files and data, including email and other applications, while away from the office. it has been referred to among system administrators as the virtual private nightmare, because it extends the secure perimeter of a corporate network into remote locations and its employees' homes. social networking and entertainment many people use the world wide web to access news, weather and sports reports, to plan and book vacations and to pursue their personal interests. people use chat, messaging and email to make and stay in touch with friends worldwide, sometimes in the same way as some previously had pen pals. social networking websites such as facebook, twitter, and myspace have created new ways to socialize and interact. users of these sites are able to add a wide variety of information to pages, to pursue common interests, and to connect with others. it is also possible to find existing acquaintances, to allow communication among existing groups of people. sites like linkedin foster commercial and business connections. youtube and flickr specialize in users' videos and photographs. while social networking sites were initially for individuals only, today they are widely used by businesses and other organizations to promote their brands, to market to their customers and to encourage posts to go viral. black hat social media techniques are also employed by some organizations, such as spam accounts and astroturfing.
a risk for both individuals and organizations writing posts (especially public posts) on social networking websites, is that especially foolish or controversial posts occasionally lead to an unexpected and possibly large-scale backlash on social media from other internet users. this is also a risk in relation to controversial offline behavior, if it is widely made known. the nature of this backlash can range widely from counter-arguments and public mockery, through insults and hate speech, to, in extreme cases, rape and death threats. the online disinhibition effect describes the tendency of many individuals to behave more stridently or offensively online than they would in person. a significant number of feminist women have been the target of various forms of harassment in response to posts they have made on social media, and twitter in particular has been criticised in the past for not doing enough to aid victims of online abuse.
for organizations, such a backlash can cause overall brand damage, especially if reported by the media. however, this is not always the case, as any brand damage in the eyes of people with an opposing opinion to that presented by the organization could sometimes be outweighed by strengthening the brand in the eyes of others. furthermore, if an organization or individual gives in to demands that others perceive as wrong-headed, that can then provoke a counter-backlash.
some websites, such as reddit, have rules forbidding the posting of personal information of individuals (also known as doxxing), due to concerns about such postings leading to mobs of large numbers of internet users directing harassment at the specific individuals thereby identified. in particular, the reddit rule forbidding the posting of personal information is widely understood to imply that all identifying photos and names must be censored in facebook screenshots posted to reddit. however, the interpretation of this rule in relation to public twitter posts is less clear, and in any case, like-minded people online have many other ways they can use to direct each other's attention to public social media posts they disagree with.
children also face dangers online such as cyberbullying and approaches by sexual predators, who sometimes pose as children themselves. children may also encounter material which they may find upsetting, or material which their parents consider to be not age-appropriate. due to naivety, they may also post personal information about themselves online, which could put them or their families at risk unless warned not to do so. many parents choose to enable internet filtering, and/or supervise their children's online activities, in an attempt to protect their children from inappropriate material on the internet. the most popular social networking websites, such as facebook and twitter, commonly forbid users under the age of 13. however, these policies are typically trivial to circumvent by registering an account with a false birth date, and a significant number of children aged under 13 join such sites anyway. social networking sites for younger children, which claim to provide better levels of protection for children, also exist.
the internet has been a major outlet for leisure activity since its inception, with entertaining social experiments such as muds and moos being conducted on university servers, and humor-related usenet groups receiving much traffic. many internet forums have sections devoted to games and funny videos. the internet pornography and online gambling industries have taken advantage of the world wide web, and often provide a significant source of advertising revenue for other websites. although many governments have attempted to restrict both industries' use of the internet, in general, this has failed to stop their widespread popularity.
another area of leisure activity on the internet is multiplayer gaming. this form of recreation creates communities, where people of all ages and origins enjoy the fast-paced world of multiplayer games. these range from mmorpg to first-person shooters, from role-playing video games to online gambling. while online gaming has been around since the 1970s, modern modes of online gaming began with subscription services such as gamespy and mplayer. non-subscribers were limited to certain types of game play or certain games. many people use the internet to access and download music, movies and other works for their enjoyment and relaxation. free and fee-based services exist for all of these activities, using centralized servers and distributed peer-to-peer technologies. some of these sources exercise more care with respect to the original artists' copyrights than others.
internet usage has been correlated to users' loneliness. lonely people tend to use the internet as an outlet for their feelings and to share their stories with others, such as in the i am lonely will anyone speak to me thread.
cybersectarianism is a new organizational form which involves: highly dispersed small groups of practitioners that may remain largely anonymous within the larger social context and operate in relative secrecy, while still linked remotely to a larger network of believers who share a set of practices and texts, and often a common devotion to a particular leader. overseas supporters provide funding and support; domestic practitioners distribute tracts, participate in acts of resistance, and share information on the internal situation with outsiders. collectively, members and practitioners of such sects construct viable virtual communities of faith, exchanging personal testimonies and engaging in the collective study via email, on-line chat rooms, and web-based message boards. in particular, the british government has raised concerns about the prospect of young british muslims being indoctrinated into islamic extremism by material on the internet, being persuaded to join terrorist groups such as the so-called islamic state, and then potentially committing acts of terrorism on returning to britain after fighting in syria or iraq.
cyberslacking can become a drain on corporate resources; the average uk employee spent 57 minutes a day surfing the web while at work, according to a 2003 study by peninsula business services. internet addiction disorder is excessive computer use that interferes with daily life. nicholas g. carr believes that internet use has other effects on individuals, for instance improving skills of scan-reading and interfering with the deep thinking that leads to true creativity. electronic business electronic business (e-business) encompasses business processes spanning the entire value chain: purchasing, supply chain management, marketing, sales, customer service, and business relationship. e-commerce seeks to add revenue streams using the internet to build and enhance relationships with clients and partners. according to international data corporation, the size of worldwide e-commerce, when global business-to-business and -consumer transactions are combined, equate to $16 trillion for 2013. a report by oxford economics adds those two together to estimate the total size of the digital economy at $20.4 trillion, equivalent to roughly 13.8% of global sales.
while much has been written of the economic advantages of internet-enabled commerce, there is also evidence that some aspects of the internet such as maps and location-aware services may serve to reinforce economic inequality and the digital divide. electronic commerce may be responsible for consolidation and the decline of mom-and-pop, brick and mortar businesses resulting in increases in income inequality.
author andrew keen, a long-time critic of the social transformations caused by the internet, has recently focused on the economic effects of consolidation from internet businesses. keen cites a 2013 institute for local self-reliance report saying brick-and-mortar retailers employ 47 people for every $10 million in sales while amazon employs only 14. similarly, the 700-employee room rental start-up airbnb was valued at $10 billion in 2014, about half as much as hilton hotels, which employs 152,000 people. and car-sharing internet startup uber employs 1,000 full-time employees and is valued at $18.2 billion, about the same valuation as avis and hertz combined, which together employ almost 60,000 people. telecommuting telecommuting is the performance within a traditional worker and employer relationship when it is facilitated by tools such as groupware, virtual private networks, conference calling, videoconferencing, and voice over ip (voip) so that work may be performed from any location, most conveniently the worker's home. it can be efficient and useful for companies as it allows workers to communicate over long distances, saving significant amounts of travel time and cost. as broadband internet connections become commonplace, more workers have adequate bandwidth at home to use these tools to link their home to their corporate intranet and internal communication networks. collaborative publishing wikis have also been used in the academic community for sharing and dissemination of information across institutional and international boundaries. in those settings, they have been found useful for collaboration on grant writing, strategic planning, departmental documentation, and committee work. the united states patent and trademark office uses a wiki to allow the public to collaborate on finding prior art relevant to examination of pending patent applications. queens, new york has used a wiki to allow citizens to collaborate on the design and planning of a local park. the english wikipedia has the largest user base among wikis on the world wide web and ranks in the top 10 among all web sites in terms of traffic. politics and political revolutions the internet has achieved new relevance as a political tool. the presidential campaign of howard dean in 2004 in the united states was notable for its success in soliciting donation via the internet. many political groups use the internet to achieve a new method of organizing for carrying out their mission, having given rise to internet activism, most notably practiced by rebels in the arab spring. the new york times suggested that social media websites, such as facebook and twitter, helped people organize the political revolutions in egypt, by helping activists organize protests, communicate grievances, and disseminate information.
the potential of the internet as a civic tool of communicative power was explored by simon r. b. berdal in his 2004 thesis: as the globally evolving internet provides ever new access points to virtual discourse forums, it also promotes new civic relations and associations within which communicative power may flow and accumulate. thus, traditionally … national-embedded peripheries get entangled into greater, international peripheries, with stronger combined powers... the internet, as a consequence, changes the topology of the centre-periphery model, by stimulating conventional peripheries to interlink into super-periphery structures, which enclose and besiege several centres at once. berdal, therefore, extends the habermasian notion of the public sphere to the internet, and underlines the inherent global and civic nature that interwoven internet technologies provide. to limit the growing civic potential of the internet, berdal also notes how self-protective measures are put in place by those threatened by it: if we consider china’s attempts to filter unsuitable material from the internet, most of us would agree that this resembles a self-protective measure by the system against the growing civic potentials of the internet. nevertheless, both types represent limitations to peripheral capacities. thus, the chinese government tries to prevent communicative power to build up and unleash (as the 1989 tiananmen square uprising suggests, the government may find it wise to install upstream measures). even though limited, the internet is proving to be an empowering tool also to the chinese periphery: analysts believe that internet petitions have influenced policy implementation in favour of the public’s online-articulated will … incidents of politically motivated internet censorship have now been recorded in many countries, including western democracies. philanthropy the spread of low-cost internet access in developing countries has opened up new possibilities for peer-to-peer charities, which allow individuals to contribute small amounts to charitable projects for other individuals. websites, such as donorschoose and globalgiving, allow small-scale donors to direct funds to individual projects of their choice. a popular twist on internet-based philanthropy is the use of peer-to-peer lending for charitable purposes. kiva pioneered this concept in 2005, offering the first web-based service to publish individual loan profiles for funding. kiva raises funds for local intermediary microfinance organizations which post stories and updates on behalf of the borrowers. lenders can contribute as little as $25 to loans of their choice, and receive their money back as borrowers repay. kiva falls short of being a pure peer-to-peer charity, in that loans are disbursed before being funded by lenders and borrowers do not communicate with lenders themselves.
however, the recent spread of low-cost internet access in developing countries has made genuine international person-to-person philanthropy increasingly feasible. in 2009, the us-based nonprofit zidisha tapped into this trend to offer the first person-to-person microfinance platform to link lenders and borrowers across international borders without intermediaries. members can fund loans for as little as a dollar, which the borrowers then use to develop business activities that improve their families' incomes while repaying loans to the members with interest. borrowers access the internet via public cybercafes, donated laptops in village schools, and even smart phones, then create their own profile pages through which they share photos and information about themselves and their businesses. as they repay their loans, borrowers continue to share updates and dialogue with lenders via their profile pages. this direct web-based connection allows members themselves to take on many of the communication and recording tasks traditionally performed by local organizations, bypassing geographic barriers and dramatically reducing the cost of microfinance services to the entrepreneurs. security internet resources, hardware, and software components are the target of criminal or malicious attempts to gain unauthorized control to cause interruptions, commit fraud, engage in blackmail or access private information. malware malicious software used and spread on the internet includes computer viruses which copy with the help of humans, computer worms which copy themselves automatically, software for denial of service attacks, ransomware, botnets, and spyware that reports on the activity and typing of users. usually, these activities constitute cybercrime. defense theorists have also speculated about the possibilities of cyber warfare using similar methods on a large scale. surveillance the vast majority of computer surveillance involves the monitoring of data and traffic on the internet. in the united states for example, under the communications assistance for law enforcement act, all phone calls and broadband internet traffic (emails, web traffic, instant messaging, etc.) are required to be available for unimpeded real-time monitoring by federal law enforcement agencies. packet capture is the monitoring of data traffic on a computer network. computers communicate over the internet by breaking up messages (emails, images, videos, web pages, files, etc.) into small chunks called packets, which are routed through a network of computers, until they reach their destination, where they are assembled back into a complete message again. packet capture appliance intercepts these packets as they are traveling through the network, in order to examine their contents using other programs. a packet capture is an information gathering tool, but not an analysis tool. that is it gathers messages but it does not analyze them and figure out what they mean. other programs are needed to perform traffic analysis and sift through intercepted data looking for important/useful information. under the communications assistance for law enforcement act all u.s. telecommunications providers are required to install packet sniffing technology to allow federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies to intercept all of their customers' broadband internet and voice over internet protocol (voip) traffic.
the large amount of data gathered from packet capturing requires surveillance software that filters and reports relevant information, such as the use of certain words or phrases, the access of certain types of web sites, or communicating via email or chat with certain parties. agencies, such as the information awareness office, nsa, gchq and the fbi, spend billions of dollars per year to develop, purchase, implement, and operate systems for interception and analysis of data. similar systems are operated by iranian secret police to identify and suppress dissidents. the required hardware and software was allegedly installed by german siemens ag and finnish nokia. censorship some governments, such as those of burma, iran, north korea, the mainland china, saudi arabia and the united arab emirates restrict access to content on the internet within their territories, especially to political and religious content, with domain name and keyword filters.
in norway, denmark, finland, and sweden, major internet service providers have voluntarily agreed to restrict access to sites listed by authorities. while this list of forbidden resources is supposed to contain only known child pornography sites, the content of the list is secret. many countries, including the united states, have enacted laws against the possession or distribution of certain material, such as child pornography, via the internet, but do not mandate filter software. many free or commercially available software programs, called content-control software are available to users to block offensive websites on individual computers or networks, in order to limit access by children to pornographic material or depiction of violence. performance as the internet is a heterogeneous network, the physical characteristics, including for example the data transfer rates of connections, vary widely. it exhibits emergent phenomena that depend on its large-scale organization. outages an internet blackout or outage can be caused by local signalling interruptions. disruptions of submarine communications cables may cause blackouts or slowdowns to large areas, such as in the 2008 submarine cable disruption. less-developed countries are more vulnerable due to a small number of high-capacity links. land cables are also vulnerable, as in 2011 when a woman digging for scrap metal severed most connectivity for the nation of armenia. internet blackouts affecting almost entire countries can be achieved by governments as a form of internet censorship, as in the blockage of the internet in egypt, whereby approximately 93% of networks were without access in 2011 in an attempt to stop mobilization for anti-government protests. energy use in 2011, researchers estimated the energy used by the internet to be between 170 and 307 gw, less than two percent of the energy used by humanity. this estimate included the energy needed to build, operate, and periodically replace the estimated 750 million laptops, a billion smart phones and 100 million servers worldwide as well as the energy that routers, cell towers, optical switches, wi-fi transmitters and cloud storage devices use when transmitting internet traffic. see also references further reading first monday, a peer-reviewed journal on the internet established in 1996 as a great cities initiative of the university library of the university of illinois at chicago, issn 1396-0466

education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits. educational methods include storytelling, discussion, teaching, training, and directed research. education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, but learners may also educate themselves. education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. the methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.
education is commonly divided formally into such stages as preschool or kindergarten, primary school, secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship.
a right to education has been recognized by some governments and the united nations. in most regions, education is compulsory up to a certain age. etymology etymologically, the word education is derived from the latin ēducātiō (a breeding, a bringing up, a rearing) from ēducō (i educate, i train) which is related to the homonym ēdūcō (i lead forth, i take out; i raise up, i erect) from ē- (from, out of) and dūcō (i lead, i conduct). history education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. in pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through imitation. story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to the next. as cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned through imitation, formal education developed. schools existed in egypt at the time of the middle kingdom. plato founded the academy in athens, the first institution of higher learning in europe. the city of alexandria in egypt, established in 330 bce, became the successor to athens as the intellectual cradle of ancient greece. there, the great library of alexandria was built in the 3rd century bce. european civilizations suffered a collapse of literacy and organization following the fall of rome in ce 476.
in china, confucius (551–479 bce), of the state of lu, was the country's most influential ancient philosopher, whose educational outlook continues to influence the societies of china and neighbours like korea, japan, and vietnam. confucius gathered disciples and searched in vain for a ruler who would adopt his ideals for good governance, but his analects were written down by followers and have continued to influence education in east asia into the modern era.
after the fall of rome, the catholic church became the sole preserver of literate scholarship in western europe. the church established cathedral schools in the early middle ages as centres of advanced education. some of these establishments ultimately evolved into medieval universities and forebears of many of europe's modern universities. during the high middle ages, chartres cathedral operated the famous and influential chartres cathedral school. the medieval universities of western christendom were well-integrated across all of western europe, encouraged freedom of inquiry, and produced a great variety of fine scholars and natural philosophers, including thomas aquinas of the university of naples, robert grosseteste of the university of oxford, an early expositor of a systematic method of scientific experimentation, and saint albert the great, a pioneer of biological field research. founded in 1088, the university of bologne is considered the first, and the oldest continually operating university.
elsewhere during the middle ages, islamic science and mathematics flourished under the islamic caliphate which was established across the middle east, extending from the iberian peninsula in the west to the indus in the east and to the almoravid dynasty and mali empire in the south.
the renaissance in europe ushered in a new age of scientific and intellectual inquiry and appreciation of ancient greek and roman civilizations. around 1450, johannes gutenberg developed a printing press, which allowed works of literature to spread more quickly. the european age of empires saw european ideas of education in philosophy, religion, arts and sciences spread out across the globe. missionaries and scholars also brought back new ideas from other civilizations – as with the jesuit china missions who played a significant role in the transmission of knowledge, science, and culture between china and europe, translating works from europe like euclid's elements for chinese scholars and the thoughts of confucius for european audiences. the enlightenment saw the emergence of a more secular educational outlook in europe.
in most countries today, full-time education, whether at school or otherwise, is compulsory for all children up to a certain age. due to this the proliferation of compulsory education, combined with population growth, unesco has calculated that in the next 30 years more people will receive formal education than in all of human history thus far. formal education formal education occurs in a structured environment whose explicit purpose is teaching students. usually, formal education takes place in a school environment with classrooms of multiple students learning together with a trained, certified teacher of the subject. most school systems are designed around a set of values or ideals that govern all educational choices in that system. such choices include curriculum, organizational models, design of the physical learning spaces (e.g. classrooms), student-teacher interactions, methods of assessment, class size, educational activities, and more. preschool preschools provide education from ages approximately three to seven, depending on the country when children enter primary education. these are also known as nursery schools and as kindergarten, except in the us, where kindergarten is a term used for primary education. kindergarten provide[s] a child-centred, preschool curriculum for three- to seven-year-old children that aim[s] at unfolding the child's physical, intellectual, and moral nature with balanced emphasis on each of them. primary primary (or elementary) education consists of the first five to seven years of formal, structured education. in general, primary education consists of six to eight years of schooling starting at the age of five or six, although this varies between, and sometimes within, countries. globally, around 89% of children aged six to twelve are enrolled in primary education, and this proportion is rising. under the education for all programs driven by unesco, most countries have committed to achieving universal enrollment in primary education by 2015, and in many countries, it is compulsory. the division between primary and secondary education is somewhat arbitrary, but it generally occurs at about eleven or twelve years of age. some education systems have separate middle schools, with the transition to the final stage of secondary education taking place at around the age of fourteen. schools that provide primary education, are mostly referred to as primary schools or elementary schools. primary schools are often subdivided into infant schools and junior school.
in india, for example, compulsory education spans over twelve years, with eight years of elementary education, five years of primary schooling and three years of upper primary schooling. various states in the republic of india provide 12 years of compulsory school education based on a national curriculum framework designed by the national council of educational research and training. secondary in most contemporary educational systems of the world, secondary education comprises the formal education that occurs during adolescence. it is characterized by transition from the typically compulsory, comprehensive primary education for minors, to the optional, selective tertiary, postsecondary, or higher education (e.g. university, vocational school) for adults. depending on the system, schools for this period, or a part of it, may be called secondary or high schools, gymnasiums, lyceums, middle schools, colleges, or vocational schools. the exact meaning of any of these terms varies from one system to another. the exact boundary between primary and secondary education also varies from country to country and even within them but is generally around the seventh to the tenth year of schooling. secondary education occurs mainly during the teenage years. in the united states, canada, and australia, primary and secondary education together are sometimes referred to as k-12 education, and in new zealand year 1–13 is used. the purpose of secondary education can be to give common knowledge, to prepare for higher education, or to train directly in a profession.
secondary education in the united states did not emerge until 1910, with the rise of large corporations and advancing technology in factories, which required skilled workers. in order to meet this new job demand, high schools were created, with a curriculum focused on practical job skills that would better prepare students for white collar or skilled blue collar work. this proved beneficial for both employers and employees, since the improved human capital lowered costs for the employer, while skilled employees received higher wages.
secondary education has a longer history in europe, where grammar schools or academies date from as early as the 16th century, in the form of public schools, fee-paying schools, or charitable educational foundations, which themselves date even further back.
community colleges offer another option at this transitional stage of education. they provide nonresidential junior college courses to people living in a particular area. tertiary (higher) higher education, also called tertiary, third stage, or postsecondary education, is the non-compulsory educational level that follows the completion of a school such as a high school or secondary school. tertiary education is normally taken to include undergraduate and postgraduate education, as well as vocational education and training. colleges and universities mainly provide tertiary education. collectively, these are sometimes known as tertiary institutions. individuals who complete tertiary education generally receive certificates, diplomas, or academic degrees.
higher education typically involves work towards a degree-level or foundation degree qualification. in most developed countries, a high proportion of the population (up to 50%) now enter higher education at some time in their lives. higher education is therefore very important to national economies, both as a significant industry in its own right and as a source of trained and educated personnel for the rest of the economy.
university education includes teaching, research, and social services activities, and it includes both the undergraduate level (sometimes referred to as tertiary education) and the graduate (or postgraduate) level (sometimes referred to as graduate school). universities are generally composed of several colleges. in the united states, universities can be private and independent like yale university; public and state-governed like the pennsylvania state system of higher education; or independent but state-funded like the university of virginia. a number of career specific courses are now available to students through the internet.
one type of university education is a liberal arts education, which can be defined as a college or university curriculum aimed at imparting broad general knowledge and developing general intellectual capacities, in contrast to a professional, vocational, or technical curriculum. although what is known today as liberal arts education began in europe, the term liberal arts college is more commonly associated with institutions in the united states. vocational vocational education is a form of education focused on direct and practical training for a specific trade or craft. vocational education may come in the form of an apprenticeship or internship as well as institutions teaching courses such as carpentry, agriculture, engineering, medicine, architecture and the arts. special in the past, those who were disabled were often not eligible for public education. children with disabilities were repeatedly denied an education by physicians or special tutors. these early physicians (people like itard, seguin, howe, gallaudet) set the foundation for special education today. they focused on individualized instruction and functional skills. in its early years, special education was only provided to people with severe disabilities, but more recently it has been opened to anyone who has experienced difficulty learning. other educational forms alternative while considered alternative today, most alternative systems have existed since ancient times. after the public school system was widely developed beginning in the 19th century, some parents found reasons to be discontented with the new system. alternative education developed in part as a reaction to perceived limitations and failings of traditional education. a broad range of educational approaches emerged, including alternative schools, self learning, homeschooling, and unschooling. example alternative schools include montessori schools, waldorf schools (or steiner schools), friends schools, sands school, summerhill school, walden's path, the peepal grove school, sudbury valley school, krishnamurti schools, and open classroom schools. charter schools are another example of alternative education, which have in the recent years grown in numbers in the us and gained greater importance in its public education system.
in time, some ideas from these experiments and paradigm challenges may be adopted as the norm in education, just as friedrich fröbel's approach to early childhood education in 19th-century germany has been incorporated into contemporary kindergarten classrooms. other influential writers and thinkers have included the swiss humanitarian johann heinrich pestalozzi; the american transcendentalists amos bronson alcott, ralph waldo emerson, and henry david thoreau; the founders of progressive education, john dewey and francis parker; and educational pioneers such as maria montessori and rudolf steiner, and more recently john caldwell holt, paul goodman, frederick mayer, george dennison, and ivan illich. indigenous indigenous education refers to the inclusion of indigenous knowledge, models, methods, and content within formal and non-formal educational systems. often in a post-colonial context, the growing recognition and use of indigenous education methods can be a response to the erosion and loss of indigenous knowledge and language through the processes of colonialism. furthermore, it can enable indigenous communities to reclaim and revalue their languages and cultures, and in so doing, improve the educational success of indigenous students. informal learning informal learning is one of three forms of learning defined by the organisation for economic co-operation and development (oecd). informal learning occurs in a variety of places, such as at home, work, and through daily interactions and shared relationships among members of society. for many learners, this includes language acquisition, cultural norms, and manners. informal learning for young people is an ongoing process that also occurs in a variety of places, such as out of school time, in youth programs at community centres and media labs.
informal learning usually takes place outside educational establishments, does not follow a specified curriculum and may originate accidentally, sporadically, in association with certain occasions, from changing practical requirements. it is not necessarily planned to be pedagogically conscious, systematic and according to subjects, but rather unconsciously incidental, holistically problem-related, and related to situation management and fitness for life. it is experienced directly in its natural function of everyday life and is often spontaneous.
the concept of 'education through recreation' was applied to childhood development in the 19th century. in the early 20th century, the concept was broadened to include young adults but the emphasis was on physical activities. l.p. jacks, also an early proponent of lifelong learning, described education through recreation: a master in the art of living draws no sharp distinction between his work and his play, his labour and his leisure, his mind and his body, his education and his recreation. he hardly knows which is which. he simply pursues his vision of excellence through whatever he is doing and leaves others to determine whether he is working or playing. to himself, he always seems to be doing both. enough for him that he does it well. education through recreation is the opportunity to learn in a seamless fashion through all of life's activities. the concept has been revived by the university of western ontario to teach anatomy to medical students. self-directed learning autodidacticism (also autodidactism) is a contemplative, absorbing process, of learning on your own or by yourself, or as a self-teacher. some autodidacts spend a great deal of time reviewing the resources of libraries and educational websites. one may become an autodidact at nearly any point in one's life. notable autodidacts include abraham lincoln (u.s. president), srinivasa ramanujan (mathematician), michael faraday (chemist and physicist), charles darwin (naturalist), thomas alva edison (inventor), tadao ando (architect), george bernard shaw (playwright), frank zappa (composer, recording engineer, film director), and leonardo da vinci (engineer, scientist, mathematician). open education and electronic technology in 2012, the modern use of electronic educational technology (also called e-learning) had grown at 14 times the rate of traditional learning. open education is fast growing to become the dominant form of education, for many reasons such as its efficiency and results compared to traditional methods. cost of education has been an issue throughout history, and a major political issue in most countries today. online courses often can be more expensive than face-to-face classes. out of 182 colleges surveyed in 2009 nearly half said tuition for online courses was higher than for campus-based ones. many large university institutions are now starting to offer free or almost free full courses such as harvard, mit and berkeley teaming up to form edx. other universities offering open education are stanford, princeton, duke, johns hopkins, edinburgh, u. penn, u. michigan, u. virginia, u. washington, and caltech. it has been called the biggest change in the way we learn since the printing press. despite favourable studies on effectiveness, many people may still desire to choose traditional campus education for social and cultural reasons.
the conventional merit-system degree is currently not as common in open education as it is in campus universities, although some open universities do already offer conventional degrees such as the open university in the united kingdom. presently, many of the major open education sources offer their own form of certificate. due to the popularity of open education, these new kind of academic certificates are gaining more respect and equal academic value to traditional degrees. many open universities are working to have the ability to offer students standardized testing and traditional degrees and credentials.
a culture is beginning to form around distance learning for people who are looking to social connections enjoyed on traditional campuses. for example, students may create study groups, meetups, and movements such as uncollege. education sector the education sector or education system is a group of institutions (ministries of education, local educational authorities, teacher training institutions, schools, universities, etc.) whose primary purpose is to provide education to children and young people in educational settings. it involves a wide range of people (curriculum developers, inspectors, school principals, teachers, school nurses, students, etc.). these institutions can vary according to different contexts.
schools deliver education, with support from the rest of the education system through various elements such as education policies and guidelines – to which school policies can refer – curricula and learning materials, as well as pre- and in-service teacher training programmes. the school environment – both physical (infrastructures) and psychological (school climate) – is also guided by school policies that should ensure the well-being of students when they are in school. the organisation for economic co-operation and development has found that schools tend to perform best when principals have full authority and responsibility for ensuring that students are proficient in core subjects upon graduation. they must also seek feedback from students for quality-assurance and improvement. governments should limit themselves to monitoring student proficiency.
the education sector is fully integrated into society, through interactions with a large number of stakeholders and other sectors. these include parents, local communities, religious leaders, ngos, stakeholders involved in health, child protection, justice and law enforcement (police), media and political leadership. development goals since 1909, the ratio of children in the developing world attending school has increased. before then, a small minority of boys attended school. by the start of the 21st century, the majority of all children in most regions of the world attended school.
universal primary education is one of the eight international millennium development goals, towards which progress has been made in the past decade, though barriers still remain. securing charitable funding from prospective donors is one particularly persistent problem. researchers at the overseas development institute have indicated that the main obstacles to funding for education include conflicting donor priorities, an immature aid architecture, and a lack of evidence and advocacy for the issue. additionally, transparency international has identified corruption in the education sector as a major stumbling block to achieving universal primary education in africa. furthermore, demand in the developing world for improved educational access is not as high as foreigners have expected. indigenous governments are reluctant to take on the ongoing costs involved. there is also economic pressure from some parents, who prefer their children to earn money in the short term rather than work towards the long-term benefits of education.
a study conducted by the unesco international institute for educational planning indicates that stronger capacities in educational planning and management may have an important spill-over effect on the system as a whole. sustainable capacity development requires complex interventions at the institutional, organizational and individual levels that could be based on some foundational principles:
national leadership and ownership should be the touchstone of any intervention;
strategies must be context relevant and context specific;
plans should employ an integrated set of complementary interventions, though implementation may need to proceed in steps;
partners should commit to a long-term investment in capacity development while working towards some short-term achievements;
outside intervention should be conditional on an impact assessment of national capacities at various levels;
a certain percentage of students should be removed for improvisation of academics (usually practiced in schools, after 10th grade). internationalization nearly every country now has universal primary education.
similarities – in systems or even in ideas – that schools share internationally have led to an increase in international student exchanges. the european socrates-erasmus program facilitates exchanges across european universities. the soros foundation provides many opportunities for students from central asia and eastern europe. programs such as the international baccalaureate have contributed to the internationalization of education. the global campus online, led by american universities, allows free access to class materials and lecture files recorded during the actual classes.
the programme for international student assessment and the international association for the evaluation of educational achievement objectively monitor and compare the proficiency of students from a wide range of different nations. education and technology in developing countries technology plays an increasingly significant role in improving access to education for people living in impoverished areas and developing countries. charities like one laptop per child are dedicated to providing infrastructures through which the disadvantaged may access educational materials.
the olpc foundation, a group out of mit media lab and supported by several major corporations, has a stated mission to develop a $100 laptop for delivering educational software. the laptops were widely available as of 2008. they are sold at cost or given away based on donations.
in africa, the new partnership for africa's development (nepad) has launched an e-school program to provide all 600,000 primary and high schools with computer equipment, learning materials and internet access within 10 years. an international development agency project called nabuur.com, started with the support of former american president bill clinton, uses the internet to allow co-operation by individuals on issues of social development.
india is developing technologies that will bypass land-based telephone and internet infrastructure to deliver distance learning directly to its students. in 2004, the indian space research organisation launched edusat, a communications satellite providing access to educational materials that can reach more of the country's population at a greatly reduced cost. private vs public funding in developing countries research into lcps (low-cost private schools) found that over 5 years to july 2013, debate around lcpss to achieving education for all (efa) objectives was polarized and finding growing coverage in international policy. the polarization was due to disputes around whether the schools are affordable for the poor, reach disadvantaged groups, provide quality education, support or undermine equality, and are financially sustainable. the report examined the main challenges encountered by development organizations which support lcpss. surveys suggest these types of schools are expanding across africa and asia. this success is attributed to excess demand. these surveys found concern for:
equity: this concern is widely found in the literature, suggesting the growth in low-cost private schooling may be exacerbating or perpetuating already existing inequalities in developing countries, between urban and rural populations, lower- and higher-income families, and between girls and boys. the report findings suggest that girls may be underrepresented and that lcps are reaching low-income families in smaller numbers than higher-income families.
quality and educational outcomes: it is difficult to generalize about the quality of private schools. while most achieve better results than government counterparts, even after their social background is taken into account, some studies find the opposite. quality in terms of levels of teacher absence, teaching activity, and pupil to teacher ratios in some countries are better in lcpss than in government schools.
choice and affordability for the poor: parents can choose private schools because of perceptions of better-quality teaching and facilities, and an english language instruction preference. nevertheless, the concept of 'choice' does not apply in all contexts, or to all groups in society, partly because of limited affordability (which excludes most of the poorest) and other forms of exclusion, related to caste or social status.
cost-effectiveness and financial sustainability: there is evidence that private schools operate at low cost by keeping teacher salaries low, and their financial situation may be precarious where they are reliant on fees from low-income households.
the report showed some cases of successful voucher and subsidy programmes; evaluations of international support to the sector are not widespread. addressing regulatory ineffectiveness is a key challenge. emerging approaches stress the importance of understanding the political economy of the market for lcps, specifically how relationships of power and accountability between users, government, and private providers can produce better education outcomes for the poor. educational theory educational psychology educational psychology is the study of how humans learn in educational settings, the effectiveness of educational interventions, the psychology of teaching, and the social psychology of schools as organizations. although the terms educational psychology and school psychology are often used interchangeably, researchers and theorists are likely to be identified as educational psychologists, whereas practitioners in schools or school-related settings are identified as school psychologists. educational psychology is concerned with the processes of educational attainment in the general population and in sub-populations such as gifted children and those with specific disabilities. educational psychology can in part be understood through its relationship with other disciplines. it is informed primarily by psychology, bearing a relationship to that discipline analogous to the relationship between medicine and biology. educational psychology, in turn, informs a wide range of specialties within educational studies, including instructional design, educational technology, curriculum development, organizational learning, special education and classroom management. educational psychology both draws from and contributes to cognitive science and the learning sciences. in universities, departments of educational psychology are usually housed within faculties of education, possibly accounting for the lack of representation of educational psychology content in introductory psychology textbooks (lucas, blazek, & raley, 2006). the intelligence–education relationship intelligence is an important factor in how the individual responds to education. those who have higher intelligence tend to perform better at school and go on to higher levels of education. this effect is also observable in the opposite direction, in that education increases measurable intelligence. studies have shown that while educational attainment is important in predicting intelligence in later life, intelligence at 53 is more closely correlated to intelligence at 8 years old than to educational attainment. learning modalities there has been much interest in learning modalities and styles over the last two decades. the most commonly employed learning modalities are:
visual: learning based on observation and seeing what is being learned.
auditory: learning based on listening to instructions/information.
kinesthetic: learning based on movement, e.g. hands-on work and engaging in activities.
other commonly employed modalities include musical, interpersonal, verbal, logical, and intrapersonal.
dunn and dunn focused on identifying relevant stimuli that may influence learning and manipulating the school environment, at about the same time as joseph renzulli recommended varying teaching strategies. howard gardner identified a wide range of modalities in his multiple intelligences theories. the myers-briggs type indicator and keirsey temperament sorter, based on the works of jung, focus on understanding how people's personality affects the way they interact personally, and how this affects the way individuals respond to each other within the learning environment. the work of david kolb and anthony gregorc's type delineator follows a similar but more simplified approach.
some theories propose that all individuals benefit from a variety of learning modalities, while others suggest that individuals may have preferred learning styles, learning more easily through visual or kinesthetic experiences. a consequence of the latter theory is that effective teaching should present a variety of teaching methods which cover all three learning modalities so that different students have equal opportunities to learn in a way that is effective for them. guy claxton has questioned the extent that learning styles such as visual, auditory and kinesthetic(vak) are helpful, particularly as they can have a tendency to label children and therefore restrict learning. recent research has argued, there is no adequate evidence base to justify incorporating learning styles assessments into general educational practice. mind, brain and education educational neuroscience is an emerging scientific field that brings together researchers in cognitive neuroscience, developmental cognitive neuroscience, educational psychology, educational technology, education theory and other related disciplines to explore the interactions between biological processes and education. researchers in educational neuroscience investigate the neural mechanisms of reading, numerical cognition, attention, and their attendant difficulties including dyslexia, dyscalculia, and adhd as they relate to education. several academic institutions around the world are beginning to devote resources to the establishment of educational neuroscience research. philosophy as an academic field, philosophy of education is the philosophical study of education and its problems (...) its central subject matter is education, and its methods are those of philosophy. the philosophy of education may be either the philosophy of the process of education or the philosophy of the discipline of education. that is, it may be part of the discipline in the sense of being concerned with the aims, forms, methods, or results of the process of educating or being educated; or it may be metadisciplinary in the sense of being concerned with the concepts, aims, and methods of the discipline. as such, it is both part of the field of education and a field of applied philosophy, drawing from fields of metaphysics, epistemology, axiology and the philosophical approaches (speculative, prescriptive or analytic) to address questions in and about pedagogy, education policy, and curriculum, as well as the process of learning, to name a few. for example, it might study what constitutes upbringing and education, the values and norms revealed through upbringing and educational practices, the limits and legitimization of education as an academic discipline, and the relation between education theory and practice. purpose of education there is no broad consensus as to what education's chief aim or aims are or should be. some authors stress its value to the individual, emphasizing its potential for positively influencing students' personal development, promoting autonomy, forming a cultural identity or establishing a career or occupation. other authors emphasize education's contributions to societal purposes, including good citizenship, shaping students into productive members of society, thereby promoting society's general economic development, and preserving cultural values. curriculum in formal education, a curriculum is the set of courses and their content offered at a school or university. as an idea, curriculum stems from the latin word for race course, referring to the course of deeds and experiences through which children grow to become mature adults. a curriculum is prescriptive and is based on a more general syllabus which merely specifies what topics must be understood and to what level to achieve a particular grade or standard.
an academic discipline is a branch of knowledge which is formally taught, either at the university–or via some other such method. each discipline usually has several sub-disciplines or branches, and distinguishing lines are often both arbitrary and ambiguous. examples of broad areas of academic disciplines include the natural sciences, mathematics, computer science, social sciences, humanities and applied sciences.
educational institutions may incorporate fine arts as part of k-12 grade curricula or within majors at colleges and universities as electives. the various types of fine arts are music, dance, and theatre. instruction instruction is the facilitation of another's learning. instructors in primary and secondary institutions are often called teachers, and they direct the education of students and might draw on many subjects like reading, writing, mathematics, science and history. instructors in post-secondary institutions might be called teachers, instructors, or professors, depending on the type of institution; and they primarily teach only their specific discipline. studies from the united states suggest that the quality of teachers is the single most important factor affecting student performance, and that countries which score highly on international tests have multiple policies in place to ensure that the teachers they employ are as effective as possible. with the passing of nclb in the united states (no child left behind), teachers must be highly qualified. a popular way to gauge teaching performance is to use student evaluations of teachers (sets), but these evaluations have been criticized for being counterproductive to learning and inaccurate due to student bias.
college basketball coach john wooden the wizard of westwood would teach through quick this not that technique. he would show (a) the correct way to perform an action, (b) the incorrect way the player performed it, and again (c) the correct way to perform an action. this helped him to be a responsive teacher and fix errors on the fly. also, less communication from him meant more time that the player could practice. economics of education it has been argued that high rates of education are essential for countries to be able to achieve high levels of economic growth. empirical analyses tend to support the theoretical prediction that poor countries should grow faster than rich countries because they can adopt cutting edge technologies already tried and tested by rich countries. however, technology transfer requires knowledgeable managers and engineers who are able to operate new machines or production practices borrowed from the leader in order to close the gap through imitation. therefore, a country's ability to learn from the leader is a function of its stock of human capital. recent study of the determinants of aggregate economic growth have stressed the importance of fundamental economic institutions and the role of cognitive skills.
at the level of the individual, there is a large literature, generally related to the work of jacob mincer, on how earnings are related to the schooling and other human capital. this work has motivated a large number of studies, but is also controversial. the chief controversies revolve around how to interpret the impact of schooling. some students who have indicated a high potential for learning, by testing with a high intelligence quotient, may not achieve their full academic potential, due to financial difficulties.
economists samuel bowles and herbert gintis argued in 1976 that there was a fundamental conflict in american schooling between the egalitarian goal of democratic participation and the inequalities implied by the continued profitability of capitalist production. the future of education many countries are now drastically changing the way they educate their citizens. the world is changing at an ever quickening rate, which means that a lot of knowledge becomes obsolete and inaccurate more quickly. the emphasis is therefore shifting to teaching the skills of learning: to picking up new knowledge quickly and in as agile a way as possible. finnish schools have even begun to move away from the regular subject-focused curricula, introducing instead developments like phenomenon-based learning, where students study concepts like climate change instead.
education is also becoming a commodity no longer reserved for children. adults need it too. some governmental bodies, like the finnish innovation fund sitra in finland, have even proposed compulsory life-long education. see also alternative education

education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits. educational methods include storytelling, discussion, teaching, training, and directed research. education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, but learners may also educate themselves. education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. the methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.
education is commonly divided formally into such stages as preschool or kindergarten, primary school, secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship.
a right to education has been recognized by some governments and the united nations. in most regions, education is compulsory up to a certain age. etymology etymologically, the word education is derived from the latin ēducātiō (a breeding, a bringing up, a rearing) from ēducō (i educate, i train) which is related to the homonym ēdūcō (i lead forth, i take out; i raise up, i erect) from ē- (from, out of) and dūcō (i lead, i conduct). history education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. in pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through imitation. story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to the next. as cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned through imitation, formal education developed. schools existed in egypt at the time of the middle kingdom. plato founded the academy in athens, the first institution of higher learning in europe. the city of alexandria in egypt, established in 330 bce, became the successor to athens as the intellectual cradle of ancient greece. there, the great library of alexandria was built in the 3rd century bce. european civilizations suffered a collapse of literacy and organization following the fall of rome in ce 476.
in china, confucius (551–479 bce), of the state of lu, was the country's most influential ancient philosopher, whose educational outlook continues to influence the societies of china and neighbours like korea, japan, and vietnam. confucius gathered disciples and searched in vain for a ruler who would adopt his ideals for good governance, but his analects were written down by followers and have continued to influence education in east asia into the modern era.
after the fall of rome, the catholic church became the sole preserver of literate scholarship in western europe. the church established cathedral schools in the early middle ages as centres of advanced education. some of these establishments ultimately evolved into medieval universities and forebears of many of europe's modern universities. during the high middle ages, chartres cathedral operated the famous and influential chartres cathedral school. the medieval universities of western christendom were well-integrated across all of western europe, encouraged freedom of inquiry, and produced a great variety of fine scholars and natural philosophers, including thomas aquinas of the university of naples, robert grosseteste of the university of oxford, an early expositor of a systematic method of scientific experimentation, and saint albert the great, a pioneer of biological field research. founded in 1088, the university of bologne is considered the first, and the oldest continually operating university.
elsewhere during the middle ages, islamic science and mathematics flourished under the islamic caliphate which was established across the middle east, extending from the iberian peninsula in the west to the indus in the east and to the almoravid dynasty and mali empire in the south.
the renaissance in europe ushered in a new age of scientific and intellectual inquiry and appreciation of ancient greek and roman civilizations. around 1450, johannes gutenberg developed a printing press, which allowed works of literature to spread more quickly. the european age of empires saw european ideas of education in philosophy, religion, arts and sciences spread out across the globe. missionaries and scholars also brought back new ideas from other civilizations – as with the jesuit china missions who played a significant role in the transmission of knowledge, science, and culture between china and europe, translating works from europe like euclid's elements for chinese scholars and the thoughts of confucius for european audiences. the enlightenment saw the emergence of a more secular educational outlook in europe.
in most countries today, full-time education, whether at school or otherwise, is compulsory for all children up to a certain age. due to this the proliferation of compulsory education, combined with population growth, unesco has calculated that in the next 30 years more people will receive formal education than in all of human history thus far. formal education formal education occurs in a structured environment whose explicit purpose is teaching students. usually, formal education takes place in a school environment with classrooms of multiple students learning together with a trained, certified teacher of the subject. most school systems are designed around a set of values or ideals that govern all educational choices in that system. such choices include curriculum, organizational models, design of the physical learning spaces (e.g. classrooms), student-teacher interactions, methods of assessment, class size, educational activities, and more. preschool preschools provide education from ages approximately three to seven, depending on the country when children enter primary education. these are also known as nursery schools and as kindergarten, except in the us, where kindergarten is a term used for primary education. kindergarten provide[s] a child-centred, preschool curriculum for three- to seven-year-old children that aim[s] at unfolding the child's physical, intellectual, and moral nature with balanced emphasis on each of them. primary primary (or elementary) education consists of the first five to seven years of formal, structured education. in general, primary education consists of six to eight years of schooling starting at the age of five or six, although this varies between, and sometimes within, countries. globally, around 89% of children aged six to twelve are enrolled in primary education, and this proportion is rising. under the education for all programs driven by unesco, most countries have committed to achieving universal enrollment in primary education by 2015, and in many countries, it is compulsory. the division between primary and secondary education is somewhat arbitrary, but it generally occurs at about eleven or twelve years of age. some education systems have separate middle schools, with the transition to the final stage of secondary education taking place at around the age of fourteen. schools that provide primary education, are mostly referred to as primary schools or elementary schools. primary schools are often subdivided into infant schools and junior school.
in india, for example, compulsory education spans over twelve years, with eight years of elementary education, five years of primary schooling and three years of upper primary schooling. various states in the republic of india provide 12 years of compulsory school education based on a national curriculum framework designed by the national council of educational research and training. secondary in most contemporary educational systems of the world, secondary education comprises the formal education that occurs during adolescence. it is characterized by transition from the typically compulsory, comprehensive primary education for minors, to the optional, selective tertiary, postsecondary, or higher education (e.g. university, vocational school) for adults. depending on the system, schools for this period, or a part of it, may be called secondary or high schools, gymnasiums, lyceums, middle schools, colleges, or vocational schools. the exact meaning of any of these terms varies from one system to another. the exact boundary between primary and secondary education also varies from country to country and even within them but is generally around the seventh to the tenth year of schooling. secondary education occurs mainly during the teenage years. in the united states, canada, and australia, primary and secondary education together are sometimes referred to as k-12 education, and in new zealand year 1–13 is used. the purpose of secondary education can be to give common knowledge, to prepare for higher education, or to train directly in a profession.
secondary education in the united states did not emerge until 1910, with the rise of large corporations and advancing technology in factories, which required skilled workers. in order to meet this new job demand, high schools were created, with a curriculum focused on practical job skills that would better prepare students for white collar or skilled blue collar work. this proved beneficial for both employers and employees, since the improved human capital lowered costs for the employer, while skilled employees received higher wages.
secondary education has a longer history in europe, where grammar schools or academies date from as early as the 16th century, in the form of public schools, fee-paying schools, or charitable educational foundations, which themselves date even further back.
community colleges offer another option at this transitional stage of education. they provide nonresidential junior college courses to people living in a particular area. tertiary (higher) higher education, also called tertiary, third stage, or postsecondary education, is the non-compulsory educational level that follows the completion of a school such as a high school or secondary school. tertiary education is normally taken to include undergraduate and postgraduate education, as well as vocational education and training. colleges and universities mainly provide tertiary education. collectively, these are sometimes known as tertiary institutions. individuals who complete tertiary education generally receive certificates, diplomas, or academic degrees.
higher education typically involves work towards a degree-level or foundation degree qualification. in most developed countries, a high proportion of the population (up to 50%) now enter higher education at some time in their lives. higher education is therefore very important to national economies, both as a significant industry in its own right and as a source of trained and educated personnel for the rest of the economy.
university education includes teaching, research, and social services activities, and it includes both the undergraduate level (sometimes referred to as tertiary education) and the graduate (or postgraduate) level (sometimes referred to as graduate school). universities are generally composed of several colleges. in the united states, universities can be private and independent like yale university; public and state-governed like the pennsylvania state system of higher education; or independent but state-funded like the university of virginia. a number of career specific courses are now available to students through the internet.
one type of university education is a liberal arts education, which can be defined as a college or university curriculum aimed at imparting broad general knowledge and developing general intellectual capacities, in contrast to a professional, vocational, or technical curriculum. although what is known today as liberal arts education began in europe, the term liberal arts college is more commonly associated with institutions in the united states. vocational vocational education is a form of education focused on direct and practical training for a specific trade or craft. vocational education may come in the form of an apprenticeship or internship as well as institutions teaching courses such as carpentry, agriculture, engineering, medicine, architecture and the arts. special in the past, those who were disabled were often not eligible for public education. children with disabilities were repeatedly denied an education by physicians or special tutors. these early physicians (people like itard, seguin, howe, gallaudet) set the foundation for special education today. they focused on individualized instruction and functional skills. in its early years, special education was only provided to people with severe disabilities, but more recently it has been opened to anyone who has experienced difficulty learning. other educational forms alternative while considered alternative today, most alternative systems have existed since ancient times. after the public school system was widely developed beginning in the 19th century, some parents found reasons to be discontented with the new system. alternative education developed in part as a reaction to perceived limitations and failings of traditional education. a broad range of educational approaches emerged, including alternative schools, self learning, homeschooling, and unschooling. example alternative schools include montessori schools, waldorf schools (or steiner schools), friends schools, sands school, summerhill school, walden's path, the peepal grove school, sudbury valley school, krishnamurti schools, and open classroom schools. charter schools are another example of alternative education, which have in the recent years grown in numbers in the us and gained greater importance in its public education system.
in time, some ideas from these experiments and paradigm challenges may be adopted as the norm in education, just as friedrich fröbel's approach to early childhood education in 19th-century germany has been incorporated into contemporary kindergarten classrooms. other influential writers and thinkers have included the swiss humanitarian johann heinrich pestalozzi; the american transcendentalists amos bronson alcott, ralph waldo emerson, and henry david thoreau; the founders of progressive education, john dewey and francis parker; and educational pioneers such as maria montessori and rudolf steiner, and more recently john caldwell holt, paul goodman, frederick mayer, george dennison, and ivan illich. indigenous indigenous education refers to the inclusion of indigenous knowledge, models, methods, and content within formal and non-formal educational systems. often in a post-colonial context, the growing recognition and use of indigenous education methods can be a response to the erosion and loss of indigenous knowledge and language through the processes of colonialism. furthermore, it can enable indigenous communities to reclaim and revalue their languages and cultures, and in so doing, improve the educational success of indigenous students. informal learning informal learning is one of three forms of learning defined by the organisation for economic co-operation and development (oecd). informal learning occurs in a variety of places, such as at home, work, and through daily interactions and shared relationships among members of society. for many learners, this includes language acquisition, cultural norms, and manners. informal learning for young people is an ongoing process that also occurs in a variety of places, such as out of school time, in youth programs at community centres and media labs.
informal learning usually takes place outside educational establishments, does not follow a specified curriculum and may originate accidentally, sporadically, in association with certain occasions, from changing practical requirements. it is not necessarily planned to be pedagogically conscious, systematic and according to subjects, but rather unconsciously incidental, holistically problem-related, and related to situation management and fitness for life. it is experienced directly in its natural function of everyday life and is often spontaneous.
the concept of 'education through recreation' was applied to childhood development in the 19th century. in the early 20th century, the concept was broadened to include young adults but the emphasis was on physical activities. l.p. jacks, also an early proponent of lifelong learning, described education through recreation: a master in the art of living draws no sharp distinction between his work and his play, his labour and his leisure, his mind and his body, his education and his recreation. he hardly knows which is which. he simply pursues his vision of excellence through whatever he is doing and leaves others to determine whether he is working or playing. to himself, he always seems to be doing both. enough for him that he does it well. education through recreation is the opportunity to learn in a seamless fashion through all of life's activities. the concept has been revived by the university of western ontario to teach anatomy to medical students. self-directed learning autodidacticism (also autodidactism) is a contemplative, absorbing process, of learning on your own or by yourself, or as a self-teacher. some autodidacts spend a great deal of time reviewing the resources of libraries and educational websites. one may become an autodidact at nearly any point in one's life. notable autodidacts include abraham lincoln (u.s. president), srinivasa ramanujan (mathematician), michael faraday (chemist and physicist), charles darwin (naturalist), thomas alva edison (inventor), tadao ando (architect), george bernard shaw (playwright), frank zappa (composer, recording engineer, film director), and leonardo da vinci (engineer, scientist, mathematician). open education and electronic technology in 2012, the modern use of electronic educational technology (also called e-learning) had grown at 14 times the rate of traditional learning. open education is fast growing to become the dominant form of education, for many reasons such as its efficiency and results compared to traditional methods. cost of education has been an issue throughout history, and a major political issue in most countries today. online courses often can be more expensive than face-to-face classes. out of 182 colleges surveyed in 2009 nearly half said tuition for online courses was higher than for campus-based ones. many large university institutions are now starting to offer free or almost free full courses such as harvard, mit and berkeley teaming up to form edx. other universities offering open education are stanford, princeton, duke, johns hopkins, edinburgh, u. penn, u. michigan, u. virginia, u. washington, and caltech. it has been called the biggest change in the way we learn since the printing press. despite favourable studies on effectiveness, many people may still desire to choose traditional campus education for social and cultural reasons.
the conventional merit-system degree is currently not as common in open education as it is in campus universities, although some open universities do already offer conventional degrees such as the open university in the united kingdom. presently, many of the major open education sources offer their own form of certificate. due to the popularity of open education, these new kind of academic certificates are gaining more respect and equal academic value to traditional degrees. many open universities are working to have the ability to offer students standardized testing and traditional degrees and credentials.
a culture is beginning to form around distance learning for people who are looking to social connections enjoyed on traditional campuses. for example, students may create study groups, meetups, and movements such as uncollege. education sector the education sector or education system is a group of institutions (ministries of education, local educational authorities, teacher training institutions, schools, universities, etc.) whose primary purpose is to provide education to children and young people in educational settings. it involves a wide range of people (curriculum developers, inspectors, school principals, teachers, school nurses, students, etc.). these institutions can vary according to different contexts.
schools deliver education, with support from the rest of the education system through various elements such as education policies and guidelines – to which school policies can refer – curricula and learning materials, as well as pre- and in-service teacher training programmes. the school environment – both physical (infrastructures) and psychological (school climate) – is also guided by school policies that should ensure the well-being of students when they are in school. the organisation for economic co-operation and development has found that schools tend to perform best when principals have full authority and responsibility for ensuring that students are proficient in core subjects upon graduation. they must also seek feedback from students for quality-assurance and improvement. governments should limit themselves to monitoring student proficiency.
the education sector is fully integrated into society, through interactions with a large number of stakeholders and other sectors. these include parents, local communities, religious leaders, ngos, stakeholders involved in health, child protection, justice and law enforcement (police), media and political leadership. development goals since 1909, the ratio of children in the developing world attending school has increased. before then, a small minority of boys attended school. by the start of the 21st century, the majority of all children in most regions of the world attended school.
universal primary education is one of the eight international millennium development goals, towards which progress has been made in the past decade, though barriers still remain. securing charitable funding from prospective donors is one particularly persistent problem. researchers at the overseas development institute have indicated that the main obstacles to funding for education include conflicting donor priorities, an immature aid architecture, and a lack of evidence and advocacy for the issue. additionally, transparency international has identified corruption in the education sector as a major stumbling block to achieving universal primary education in africa. furthermore, demand in the developing world for improved educational access is not as high as foreigners have expected. indigenous governments are reluctant to take on the ongoing costs involved. there is also economic pressure from some parents, who prefer their children to earn money in the short term rather than work towards the long-term benefits of education.
a study conducted by the unesco international institute for educational planning indicates that stronger capacities in educational planning and management may have an important spill-over effect on the system as a whole. sustainable capacity development requires complex interventions at the institutional, organizational and individual levels that could be based on some foundational principles:
national leadership and ownership should be the touchstone of any intervention;
strategies must be context relevant and context specific;
plans should employ an integrated set of complementary interventions, though implementation may need to proceed in steps;
partners should commit to a long-term investment in capacity development while working towards some short-term achievements;
outside intervention should be conditional on an impact assessment of national capacities at various levels;
a certain percentage of students should be removed for improvisation of academics (usually practiced in schools, after 10th grade). internationalization nearly every country now has universal primary education.
similarities – in systems or even in ideas – that schools share internationally have led to an increase in international student exchanges. the european socrates-erasmus program facilitates exchanges across european universities. the soros foundation provides many opportunities for students from central asia and eastern europe. programs such as the international baccalaureate have contributed to the internationalization of education. the global campus online, led by american universities, allows free access to class materials and lecture files recorded during the actual classes.
the programme for international student assessment and the international association for the evaluation of educational achievement objectively monitor and compare the proficiency of students from a wide range of different nations. education and technology in developing countries technology plays an increasingly significant role in improving access to education for people living in impoverished areas and developing countries. charities like one laptop per child are dedicated to providing infrastructures through which the disadvantaged may access educational materials.
the olpc foundation, a group out of mit media lab and supported by several major corporations, has a stated mission to develop a $100 laptop for delivering educational software. the laptops were widely available as of 2008. they are sold at cost or given away based on donations.
in africa, the new partnership for africa's development (nepad) has launched an e-school program to provide all 600,000 primary and high schools with computer equipment, learning materials and internet access within 10 years. an international development agency project called nabuur.com, started with the support of former american president bill clinton, uses the internet to allow co-operation by individuals on issues of social development.
india is developing technologies that will bypass land-based telephone and internet infrastructure to deliver distance learning directly to its students. in 2004, the indian space research organisation launched edusat, a communications satellite providing access to educational materials that can reach more of the country's population at a greatly reduced cost. private vs public funding in developing countries research into lcps (low-cost private schools) found that over 5 years to july 2013, debate around lcpss to achieving education for all (efa) objectives was polarized and finding growing coverage in international policy. the polarization was due to disputes around whether the schools are affordable for the poor, reach disadvantaged groups, provide quality education, support or undermine equality, and are financially sustainable. the report examined the main challenges encountered by development organizations which support lcpss. surveys suggest these types of schools are expanding across africa and asia. this success is attributed to excess demand. these surveys found concern for:
equity: this concern is widely found in the literature, suggesting the growth in low-cost private schooling may be exacerbating or perpetuating already existing inequalities in developing countries, between urban and rural populations, lower- and higher-income families, and between girls and boys. the report findings suggest that girls may be underrepresented and that lcps are reaching low-income families in smaller numbers than higher-income families.
quality and educational outcomes: it is difficult to generalize about the quality of private schools. while most achieve better results than government counterparts, even after their social background is taken into account, some studies find the opposite. quality in terms of levels of teacher absence, teaching activity, and pupil to teacher ratios in some countries are better in lcpss than in government schools.
choice and affordability for the poor: parents can choose private schools because of perceptions of better-quality teaching and facilities, and an english language instruction preference. nevertheless, the concept of 'choice' does not apply in all contexts, or to all groups in society, partly because of limited affordability (which excludes most of the poorest) and other forms of exclusion, related to caste or social status.
cost-effectiveness and financial sustainability: there is evidence that private schools operate at low cost by keeping teacher salaries low, and their financial situation may be precarious where they are reliant on fees from low-income households.
the report showed some cases of successful voucher and subsidy programmes; evaluations of international support to the sector are not widespread. addressing regulatory ineffectiveness is a key challenge. emerging approaches stress the importance of understanding the political economy of the market for lcps, specifically how relationships of power and accountability between users, government, and private providers can produce better education outcomes for the poor. educational theory educational psychology educational psychology is the study of how humans learn in educational settings, the effectiveness of educational interventions, the psychology of teaching, and the social psychology of schools as organizations. although the terms educational psychology and school psychology are often used interchangeably, researchers and theorists are likely to be identified as educational psychologists, whereas practitioners in schools or school-related settings are identified as school psychologists. educational psychology is concerned with the processes of educational attainment in the general population and in sub-populations such as gifted children and those with specific disabilities. educational psychology can in part be understood through its relationship with other disciplines. it is informed primarily by psychology, bearing a relationship to that discipline analogous to the relationship between medicine and biology. educational psychology, in turn, informs a wide range of specialties within educational studies, including instructional design, educational technology, curriculum development, organizational learning, special education and classroom management. educational psychology both draws from and contributes to cognitive science and the learning sciences. in universities, departments of educational psychology are usually housed within faculties of education, possibly accounting for the lack of representation of educational psychology content in introductory psychology textbooks (lucas, blazek, & raley, 2006). the intelligence–education relationship intelligence is an important factor in how the individual responds to education. those who have higher intelligence tend to perform better at school and go on to higher levels of education. this effect is also observable in the opposite direction, in that education increases measurable intelligence. studies have shown that while educational attainment is important in predicting intelligence in later life, intelligence at 53 is more closely correlated to intelligence at 8 years old than to educational attainment. learning modalities there has been much interest in learning modalities and styles over the last two decades. the most commonly employed learning modalities are:
visual: learning based on observation and seeing what is being learned.
auditory: learning based on listening to instructions/information.
kinesthetic: learning based on movement, e.g. hands-on work and engaging in activities.
other commonly employed modalities include musical, interpersonal, verbal, logical, and intrapersonal.
dunn and dunn focused on identifying relevant stimuli that may influence learning and manipulating the school environment, at about the same time as joseph renzulli recommended varying teaching strategies. howard gardner identified a wide range of modalities in his multiple intelligences theories. the myers-briggs type indicator and keirsey temperament sorter, based on the works of jung, focus on understanding how people's personality affects the way they interact personally, and how this affects the way individuals respond to each other within the learning environment. the work of david kolb and anthony gregorc's type delineator follows a similar but more simplified approach.
some theories propose that all individuals benefit from a variety of learning modalities, while others suggest that individuals may have preferred learning styles, learning more easily through visual or kinesthetic experiences. a consequence of the latter theory is that effective teaching should present a variety of teaching methods which cover all three learning modalities so that different students have equal opportunities to learn in a way that is effective for them. guy claxton has questioned the extent that learning styles such as visual, auditory and kinesthetic(vak) are helpful, particularly as they can have a tendency to label children and therefore restrict learning. recent research has argued, there is no adequate evidence base to justify incorporating learning styles assessments into general educational practice. mind, brain and education educational neuroscience is an emerging scientific field that brings together researchers in cognitive neuroscience, developmental cognitive neuroscience, educational psychology, educational technology, education theory and other related disciplines to explore the interactions between biological processes and education. researchers in educational neuroscience investigate the neural mechanisms of reading, numerical cognition, attention, and their attendant difficulties including dyslexia, dyscalculia, and adhd as they relate to education. several academic institutions around the world are beginning to devote resources to the establishment of educational neuroscience research. philosophy as an academic field, philosophy of education is the philosophical study of education and its problems (...) its central subject matter is education, and its methods are those of philosophy. the philosophy of education may be either the philosophy of the process of education or the philosophy of the discipline of education. that is, it may be part of the discipline in the sense of being concerned with the aims, forms, methods, or results of the process of educating or being educated; or it may be metadisciplinary in the sense of being concerned with the concepts, aims, and methods of the discipline. as such, it is both part of the field of education and a field of applied philosophy, drawing from fields of metaphysics, epistemology, axiology and the philosophical approaches (speculative, prescriptive or analytic) to address questions in and about pedagogy, education policy, and curriculum, as well as the process of learning, to name a few. for example, it might study what constitutes upbringing and education, the values and norms revealed through upbringing and educational practices, the limits and legitimization of education as an academic discipline, and the relation between education theory and practice. purpose of education there is no broad consensus as to what education's chief aim or aims are or should be. some authors stress its value to the individual, emphasizing its potential for positively influencing students' personal development, promoting autonomy, forming a cultural identity or establishing a career or occupation. other authors emphasize education's contributions to societal purposes, including good citizenship, shaping students into productive members of society, thereby promoting society's general economic development, and preserving cultural values. curriculum in formal education, a curriculum is the set of courses and their content offered at a school or university. as an idea, curriculum stems from the latin word for race course, referring to the course of deeds and experiences through which children grow to become mature adults. a curriculum is prescriptive and is based on a more general syllabus which merely specifies what topics must be understood and to what level to achieve a particular grade or standard.
an academic discipline is a branch of knowledge which is formally taught, either at the university–or via some other such method. each discipline usually has several sub-disciplines or branches, and distinguishing lines are often both arbitrary and ambiguous. examples of broad areas of academic disciplines include the natural sciences, mathematics, computer science, social sciences, humanities and applied sciences.
educational institutions may incorporate fine arts as part of k-12 grade curricula or within majors at colleges and universities as electives. the various types of fine arts are music, dance, and theatre. instruction instruction is the facilitation of another's learning. instructors in primary and secondary institutions are often called teachers, and they direct the education of students and might draw on many subjects like reading, writing, mathematics, science and history. instructors in post-secondary institutions might be called teachers, instructors, or professors, depending on the type of institution; and they primarily teach only their specific discipline. studies from the united states suggest that the quality of teachers is the single most important factor affecting student performance, and that countries which score highly on international tests have multiple policies in place to ensure that the teachers they employ are as effective as possible. with the passing of nclb in the united states (no child left behind), teachers must be highly qualified. a popular way to gauge teaching performance is to use student evaluations of teachers (sets), but these evaluations have been criticized for being counterproductive to learning and inaccurate due to student bias.
college basketball coach john wooden the wizard of westwood would teach through quick this not that technique. he would show (a) the correct way to perform an action, (b) the incorrect way the player performed it, and again (c) the correct way to perform an action. this helped him to be a responsive teacher and fix errors on the fly. also, less communication from him meant more time that the player could practice. economics of education it has been argued that high rates of education are essential for countries to be able to achieve high levels of economic growth. empirical analyses tend to support the theoretical prediction that poor countries should grow faster than rich countries because they can adopt cutting edge technologies already tried and tested by rich countries. however, technology transfer requires knowledgeable managers and engineers who are able to operate new machines or production practices borrowed from the leader in order to close the gap through imitation. therefore, a country's ability to learn from the leader is a function of its stock of human capital. recent study of the determinants of aggregate economic growth have stressed the importance of fundamental economic institutions and the role of cognitive skills.
at the level of the individual, there is a large literature, generally related to the work of jacob mincer, on how earnings are related to the schooling and other human capital. this work has motivated a large number of studies, but is also controversial. the chief controversies revolve around how to interpret the impact of schooling. some students who have indicated a high potential for learning, by testing with a high intelligence quotient, may not achieve their full academic potential, due to financial difficulties.
economists samuel bowles and herbert gintis argued in 1976 that there was a fundamental conflict in american schooling between the egalitarian goal of democratic participation and the inequalities implied by the continued profitability of capitalist production. the future of education many countries are now drastically changing the way they educate their citizens. the world is changing at an ever quickening rate, which means that a lot of knowledge becomes obsolete and inaccurate more quickly. the emphasis is therefore shifting to teaching the skills of learning: to picking up new knowledge quickly and in as agile a way as possible. finnish schools have even begun to move away from the regular subject-focused curricula, introducing instead developments like phenomenon-based learning, where students study concepts like climate change instead.
education is also becoming a commodity no longer reserved for children. adults need it too. some governmental bodies, like the finnish innovation fund sitra in finland, have even proposed compulsory life-long education. see also alternative education

a wheel is a circular component that is intended to rotate on an axle bearing. the wheel is one of the main components of the wheel and axle which is one of the six simple machines. wheels, in conjunction with axles, allow heavy objects to be moved easily facilitating movement or transportation while supporting a load, or performing labor in machines. wheels are also used for other purposes, such as a ship's wheel, steering wheel, potter's wheel and flywheel.
common examples are found in transport applications. a wheel greatly reduces friction by facilitating motion by rolling together with the use of axles. in order for wheels to rotate, a moment needs to be applied to the wheel about its axis, either by way of gravity or by the application of another external force or torque. etymology the english word wheel comes from the old english word hweol, hweogol, from proto-germanic *hwehwlan, *hwegwlan, from proto-indo-european *kwekwlo-, an extended form of the root *kwel- to revolve, move around. cognates within indo-european include icelandic hjól wheel, tyre, greek κύκλος kúklos, and sanskrit chakra, the latter both meaning circle or wheel. history the invention of the wheel falls into the late neolithic, and may be seen in conjunction with other technological advances that gave rise to the early bronze age. note that this implies the passage of several wheel-less millennia even after the invention of agriculture and of pottery, during the aceramic neolithic (9500–6500 bce).
4500–3300 bce: chalcolithic, invention of the potter's wheel; earliest wooden wheels (disks with a hole for the axle); earliest wheeled vehicles, domestication of the horse
3300–2200 bce: early bronze age
2200–1550 bce: middle bronze age, invention of the spoked wheel and the chariot the halaf culture of 6500–5100 bce is sometimes credited with the earliest depiction of a wheeled vehicle, but this is doubtful as there is no evidence of halafians using either wheeled vehicles or even pottery wheels.
precursors of wheels, known as tournettes or slow wheels, were known in the middle east by the 5th millennium bce (one of the earliest examples was discovered at tepe pardis, iran, and dated to 5200–4700 bce). these were made of stone or clay and secured to the ground with a peg in the center, but required significant effort to turn. true (freely-spinning) potter's wheels were apparently in use in mesopotamia by 3500 bce and possibly as early as 4000 bce, and the oldest surviving example, which was found in ur (modern day iraq), dates to approximately 3100 bce.
the first evidence of wheeled vehicles appears in the second half of the 4th millennium bce, near-simultaneously in mesopotamia (sumerian civilization), the northern caucasus (maykop culture) and central europe (cucuteni-trypillian culture), so the question of which culture originally invented the wheeled vehicle is still unsolved.
the earliest well-dated depiction of a wheeled vehicle (here a wagon — four wheels, two axles) is on the bronocice pot, a c. 3500 – 3350 bce clay pot excavated in a funnelbeaker culture settlement in southern poland.
the oldest securely dated real wheel-axle combination, that from stare gmajne near ljubljana in slovenia (ljubljana marshes wooden wheel) is now dated within two standard deviations to 3340–3030 bce, the axle to 3360–3045 bce.
two types of early neolithic european wheel and axle are known; a circumalpine type of wagon construction (the wheel and axle rotate together, as in ljubljana marshes wheel), and that of the baden culture in hungary (axle does not rotate). they both are dated to c. 3200–3000 bce.
in china, the wheel was certainly present with the adoption of the chariot in c. 1200 bce, although barbieri-low argues for earlier chinese wheeled vehicles, c. 2000 bc.
in britain, a large wooden wheel, measuring about 1 m (3.3 ft) in diameter, was uncovered at the must farm site in east anglia in 2016. the specimen, dating from 1,100–800 years bce, represents the most complete and earliest of its type found in britain. the wheel's hub is also present. a horse's spine found nearby suggests the wheel may have been part of a horse-drawn cart. the wheel was found in a settlement built on stilts over wetland, indicating that the settlement had some sort of link to dry land.
although they did not develop the wheel proper, the olmec and certain other american cultures seem to have approached it, as wheel-like worked stones have been found on objects identified as children's toys dating to about 1500 bc. it is thought that the primary obstacle to large-scale development of the wheel in the americas was the absence of domesticated large animals which could be used to pull wheeled carriages. the closest relative of cattle present in americas in pre-columbian times, the american bison, is difficult to domesticate and was never domesticated by native americans; several horse species existed until about 12,000 years ago, but ultimately became extinct. the only large animal that was domesticated in the western hemisphere, the llama, did not spread far beyond the andes by the time of the arrival of columbus.
nubians from after about 400 bce used wheels for spinning pottery and as water wheels. it is thought that nubian waterwheels may have been ox-driven. it is also known that nubians used horse-drawn chariots imported from egypt.
the wheel was barely used, with the exception of ethiopia and somalia, in sub-saharan africa well into the 19th century but this changed with the arrival of the europeans. early wheels were simple wooden disks with a hole for the axle. some of the earliest wheels were made from horizontal slices of tree trunks. because of the uneven structure of wood, a wheel made from a horizontal slice of a tree trunk will tend to be inferior to one made from rounded pieces of longitudinal boards. the spoked wheel was invented more recently, and allowed the construction of lighter and swifter vehicles. in the harappan civilization of the indus valley and northwestern india, we find toy-cart wheels made of clay with lines which have been interpreted as spokes painted or in relief, and a symbol interpreted as a spoked wheel in the script of the seals, already in the second half of the 3rd millennium bce. the earliest known examples of wooden spoked wheels are in the context of the andronovo culture, dating to c. 2000 bce. soon after this, horse cultures of the caucasus region used horse-drawn spoked-wheel war chariots for the greater part of three centuries. they moved deep into the greek peninsula where they joined with the existing mediterranean peoples to give rise, eventually, to classical greece after the breaking of minoan dominance and consolidations led by pre-classical sparta and athens. celtic chariots introduced an iron rim around the wheel in the 1st millennium bce. the spoked wheel was in continued use without major modification until the 1870s, when wire-spoked wheels and pneumatic tires were invented. the wire spokes are under tension, not compression, making it possible for the wheel to be both stiff and light. early radially-spoked wire wheels gave rise to tangentially-spoked wire wheels, which were widely used on cars into the late 20th century. cast alloy wheels are now more commonly used; forged alloy wheels are used when weight is critical.
the invention of the wheel has also been important for technology in general, important applications including the water wheel, the cogwheel (see also antikythera mechanism), the spinning wheel, and the astrolabe or torquetum. more modern descendants of the wheel include the propeller, the jet engine, the flywheel (gyroscope) and the turbine. mechanics and function the low resistance to motion (compared to dragging) is explained as follows (refer to friction):
the normal force at the sliding interface is the same.
the sliding distance is reduced for a given distance of travel.
the coefficient of friction at the interface is usually lower.
bearings are used to help reduce friction at the interface. in the simplest and oldest case the bearing is just a round hole through which the axle passes (a plain bearing).
example:
if a 100 kg object is dragged for 10 m along a surface with the coefficient of friction μ 0.5, the normal force is 981 n and the work done (required energy) is (workforce x distance) 981 × 0.5 × 10 4905 joules.
now give the object 4 wheels. the normal force between the 4 wheels and axles is the same (in total) 981 n. assume, for wood, μ 0.25, and say the wheel diameter is 1000 mm and axle diameter is 50 mm. so while the object still moves 10 m the sliding frictional surfaces only slide over each other a distance of 0.5 m. the work done is 981 × 0.25 × 0.5 123 joules; the work done has reduced to 1/40 of that of dragging.
additional energy is lost from the wheel-to-road interface. this is termed rolling resistance which is predominantly a deformation loss. this energy is also lowered by the use of a wheel (in comparison to dragging) because the net force on the contact point between the road and the wheel is almost perpendicular to the ground, and hence, generates an almost zero net work. this depends on the nature of the ground, of the material of the wheel, its inflation in the case of a tire, the net torque exerted by the eventual engine, and many other factors.
a wheel can also offer advantages in traversing irregular surfaces if the wheel radius is sufficiently large compared to the irregularities.
the wheel alone is not a machine, but when attached to an axle in conjunction with bearing, it forms the wheel and axle, one of the simple machines. a driven wheel is an example of a wheel and axle. note that wheels pre-date driven wheels by about 6000 years, themselves an evolution of using round logs as rollers to move a heavy load—a practice going back in pre-history so far, it has not been dated. construction rim the rim is the outer edge of a wheel, holding the tire. it makes up the outer circular design of the wheel on which the inside edge of the tire is mounted on vehicles such as automobiles. for example, on a bicycle wheel the rim is a large hoop attached to the outer ends of the spokes of the wheel that holds the tire and tube.
in the 1st millennium bce an iron rim was introduced around the wooden wheels of chariots. hub the hub is the center of the wheel, and typically houses a bearing, and is where the spokes meet.
a hubless wheel (also known as a rim-rider or centerless wheel) is a type of wheel with no center hub. more specifically, the hub is actually almost as big as the wheel itself. the axle is hollow, following the wheel at very close tolerances. spokes a spoke is one of some number of rods radiating from the center of a wheel (the hub where the axle connects), connecting the hub with the round traction surface. the term originally referred to portions of a log which had been split lengthwise into four or six sections. the radial members of a wagon wheel were made by carving a spoke (from a log) into their finished shape. a spokeshave is a tool originally developed for this purpose. eventually, the term spoke was more commonly applied to the finished product of the wheelwright's work, than to the materials used. wire the rims of wire wheels (or wire spoked wheels) are connected to their hubs by wire spokes. although these wires are generally stiffer than a typical wire rope, they function mechanically the same as tensioned flexible wires, keeping the rim true while supporting applied loads.
wire wheels are used on most bicycles and still used on many motorcycles. they were invented by aeronautical engineer george cayley and first used in bicycles by james starley. a process of assembling wire wheels is described as wheelbuilding. tire/tyre a tire (in american english and canadian english) or tyre (in some commonwealth nations such as uk, india, south africa and australia) is a ring-shaped covering that fits around a wheel rim to protect it and enable better vehicle performance by providing a flexible cushion that absorbs shock while keeping the wheel in close contact with the ground. the word itself may be derived from the word tie, which refers to the outer steel ring part of a wooden cart wheel that ties the wood segments together (see etymology below).
the fundamental materials of modern tires are synthetic rubber, natural rubber, fabric and wire, along with other compound chemicals. they consist of a tread and a body. the tread provides traction while the body ensures support. before rubber was invented, the first versions of tires were simply bands of metal that fitted around wooden wheels to prevent wear and tear. today, the vast majority of tires are pneumatic inflatable structures, comprising a doughnut-shaped body of cords and wires encased in rubber and generally filled with compressed air to form an inflatable cushion. pneumatic tires are used on many types of vehicles, such as cars, bicycles, motorcycles, trucks, earthmovers, and aircraft. trywheel a trywheel is an arrangement of three wheels mounted on a y-shaped frame for the purpose of passing over stairs or rough ground. these may be driven by external force or integral motors. patenting the wheel to the 21st century observer, a wheel appears to be a fairly simple thing, but there have been many attempts to improve, and patent the wheel.

in many cases, the idea was to create a resilient wheel. this function is now provided by what's known as the pneumatic tyre. alternatives while wheels are very widely used for ground transport, there are alternatives, some of which are suitable for terrain where wheels are ineffective. alternative methods for ground transport without wheels include:
electromagnetic maglev trains
sled or travois
hovercraft
a walking machine
caterpillar tracks (although it is still operated by wheels)
pedrail wheels, using aspects of both wheel and caterpillar track
spheres, as used by dyson vacuum cleaners and hamster balls
screw-propelled vehicle
a recent invention is the so-called liddiard wheel, which claims to be a superior omnidirectional wheel. symbolism the wheel has also become a strong cultural and spiritual metaphor for a cycle or regular repetition (see chakra, reincarnation, yin and yang among others). as such and because of the difficult terrain, wheeled vehicles were forbidden in old tibet. the wheel in ancient china is seen as a symbol of health and strength and utilized by some villages as a tool to predict future health and success. the diameter of the wheel is indicator of one's future health.
the winged wheel is a symbol of progress, seen in many contexts including the coat of arms of panama, the logo of the ohio state highway patrol and the state railway of thailand. the wheel is also the prominent figure on the flag of india. the wheel in this case represents law (dharma). it also appears in the flag of the romani people, hinting to their nomadic history and their indian origins.
the introduction of spoked (chariot) wheels in the middle bronze age appears to have carried somewhat of a prestige. the sun cross appears to have a significance in bronze age religion, replacing the earlier concept of a solar barge with the more modern and technologically advanced solar chariot. the wheel was also a solar symbol for the ancient egyptians. see also types: alloy wheel, artillery wheel, bicycle wheel, big wheel, caster, pressed steel wheel, driving wheel, hubless wheel, mansell wheel, mecanum wheel, omni wheel, tweel, square wheel, steering wheel (ship's wheel), train wheel, wire wheels

fire is hot because the conversion of the weak double bond in molecular oxygen, o2, to the stronger bonds in the combustion products carbon dioxide and water releases energy (418 kj per 32 g of o2); the bond energies of the fuel play only a minor role here. at a certain point in the combustion reaction, called the ignition point, flames are produced. the flame is the visible portion of the fire. flames consist primarily of carbon dioxide, water vapor, oxygen and nitrogen. if hot enough, the gases may become ionized to produce plasma. depending on the substances alight, and any impurities outside, the color of the flame and the fire's intensity will be different.
fire in its most common form can result in conflagration, which has the potential to cause physical damage through burning. fire is an important process that affects ecological systems around the globe. the positive effects of fire include stimulating growth and maintaining various ecological systems.
the negative effects of fire include hazard to life and property, atmospheric pollution, and water contamination. if fire removes protective vegetation, heavy rainfall may lead to an increase in soil erosion by water. also, when vegetation is burned, the nitrogen it contains is released into the atmosphere, unlike elements such as potassium and phosphorus which remain in the ash and are quickly recycled into the soil. this loss of nitrogen caused by a fire produces a long-term reduction in the fertility of the soil, which only slowly recovers as nitrogen is fixed from the atmosphere by lightning and by leguminous plants such as clover.
fire has been used by humans in rituals, in agriculture for clearing land, for cooking, generating heat and light, for signaling, propulsion purposes, smelting, forging, incineration of waste, cremation, and as a weapon or mode of destruction. physical properties chemistry fires start when a flammable or a combustible material, in combination with a sufficient quantity of an oxidizer such as oxygen gas or another oxygen-rich compound (though non-oxygen oxidizers exist), is exposed to a source of heat or ambient temperature above the flash point for the fuel/oxidizer mix, and is able to sustain a rate of rapid oxidation that produces a chain reaction. this is commonly called the fire tetrahedron. fire cannot exist without all of these elements in place and in the right proportions. for example, an inflammable liquid will start burning only if the fuel and oxygen are in the right proportions. some fuel-oxygen mixes may require a catalyst, a substance that is not consumed, when added, in any chemical reaction during combustion, but which enables the reactants to combust more readily.
once ignited, a chain reaction must take place whereby fires can sustain their own heat by the further release of heat energy in the process of combustion and may propagate, provided there is a continuous supply of an oxidizer and fuel.
if the oxidizer is oxygen from the surrounding air, the presence of a force of gravity, or of some similar force caused by acceleration, is necessary to produce convection, which removes combustion products and brings a supply of oxygen to the fire. without gravity, a fire rapidly surrounds itself with its own combustion products and non-oxidizing gases from the air, which exclude oxygen and extinguish the fire. because of this, the risk of fire in a spacecraft is small when it is coasting in inertial flight. of course, this does not apply if oxygen is supplied to the fire by some process other than thermal convection.
fire can be extinguished by removing any one of the elements of the fire tetrahedron. consider a natural gas flame, such as from a stovetop burner. the fire can be extinguished by any of the following:
turning off the gas supply, which removes the fuel source;
covering the flame completely, which smothers the flame as the combustion both uses the available oxidizer (the oxygen in the air) and displaces it from the area around the flame with co2;
application of water, which removes heat from the fire faster than the fire can produce it (similarly, blowing hard on a flame will displace the heat of the currently burning gas from its fuel source, to the same end), or
application of a retardant chemical such as halon to the flame, which retards the chemical reaction itself until the rate of combustion is too slow to maintain the chain reaction.
in contrast, fire is intensified by increasing the overall rate of combustion. methods to do this include balancing the input of fuel and oxidizer to stoichiometric proportions, increasing fuel and oxidizer input in this balanced mix, increasing the ambient temperature so the fire's own heat is better able to sustain combustion, or providing a catalyst; a non-reactant medium in which the fuel and oxidizer can more readily react. flame a flame is a mixture of reacting gases and solids emitting visible, infrared, and sometimes ultraviolet light, the frequency spectrum of which depends on the chemical composition of the burning material and intermediate reaction products. in many cases, such as the burning of organic matter, for example wood, or the incomplete combustion of gas, incandescent solid particles called soot produce the familiar red-orange glow of 'fire'. this light has a continuous spectrum. complete combustion of gas has a dim blue color due to the emission of single-wavelength radiation from various electron transitions in the excited molecules formed in the flame. usually oxygen is involved, but hydrogen burning in chlorine also produces a flame, producing hydrogen chloride (hcl). other possible combinations producing flames, amongst many, are fluorine and hydrogen, and hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide. hydrogen and hydrazine/udmh flames are similarly pale blue, while burning boron and its compounds, evaluated in mid-20th century as a high energy fuel for jet and rocket engines, emits intense green flame, leading to its informal nickname of green dragon.
the glow of a flame is complex. black-body radiation is emitted from soot, gas, and fuel particles, though the soot particles are too small to behave like perfect blackbodies. there is also photon emission by de-excited atoms and molecules in the gases. much of the radiation is emitted in the visible and infrared bands. the color depends on temperature for the black-body radiation, and on chemical makeup for the emission spectra. the dominant color in a flame changes with temperature. the photo of the forest fire in canada is an excellent example of this variation. near the ground, where most burning is occurring, the fire is white, the hottest color possible for organic material in general, or yellow. above the yellow region, the color changes to orange, which is cooler, then red, which is cooler still. above the red region, combustion no longer occurs, and the uncombusted carbon particles are visible as black smoke.
the common distribution of a flame under normal gravity conditions depends on convection, as soot tends to rise to the top of a general flame, as in a candle in normal gravity conditions, making it yellow. in micro gravity or zero gravity, such as an environment in outer space, convection no longer occurs, and the flame becomes spherical, with a tendency to become more blue and more efficient (although it may go out if not moved steadily, as the co2 from combustion does not disperse as readily in micro gravity, and tends to smother the flame). there are several possible explanations for this difference, of which the most likely is that the temperature is sufficiently evenly distributed that soot is not formed and complete combustion occurs. experiments by nasa reveal that diffusion flames in micro gravity allow more soot to be completely oxidized after they are produced than diffusion flames on earth, because of a series of mechanisms that behave differently in micro gravity when compared to normal gravity conditions. these discoveries have potential applications in applied science and industry, especially concerning fuel efficiency.
in combustion engines, various steps are taken to eliminate a flame. the method depends mainly on whether the fuel is oil, wood, or a high-energy fuel such as jet fuel. flame temperatures temperatures of flames by appearance it is true that objects at specific temperatures do radiate visible light. objects whose surface is at a temperature above approximately 400 °c (752 °f) will glow, emitting light at a color that indicates the temperature of that surface. see the section on red heat for more about this effect. it is a misconception that one can judge the temperature of a fire by the color of its flames or the sparks in the flames. for many reasons, chemically and optically, these colors may not match the red/orange/yellow/white heat temperatures on the chart. barium nitrate burns a bright green, for instance, and this is not present on the heat chart. typical temperatures of flames the adiabatic flame temperature of a given fuel and oxidizer pair indicates the temperature at which the gases achieve stable combustion.

always hotter in the middle. fire ecology every natural ecosystem has its own fire regime, and the organisms in those ecosystems are adapted to or dependent upon that fire regime. fire creates a mosaic of different habitat patches, each at a different stage of succession. different species of plants, animals, and microbes specialize in exploiting a particular stage, and by creating these different types of patches, fire allows a greater number of species to exist within a landscape. fossil record the fossil record of fire first appears with the establishment of a land-based flora in the middle ordovician period, 470 million years ago, permitting the accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere as never before, as the new hordes of land plants pumped it out as a waste product. when this concentration rose above 13%, it permitted the possibility of wildfire. wildfire is first recorded in the late silurian fossil record, 420 million years ago, by fossils of charcoalified plants. apart from a controversial gap in the late devonian, charcoal is present ever since. the level of atmospheric oxygen is closely related to the prevalence of charcoal: clearly oxygen is the key factor in the abundance of wildfire. fire also became more abundant when grasses radiated and became the dominant component of many ecosystems, around 6 to 7 million years ago; this kindling provided tinder which allowed for the more rapid spread of fire. these widespread fires may have initiated a positive feedback process, whereby they produced a warmer, drier climate more conducive to fire. human control the ability to control fire was a dramatic change in the habits of early humans. making fire to generate heat and light made it possible for people to cook food, simultaneously increasing the variety and availability of nutrients and reducing disease by killing organisms in the food. the heat produced would also help people stay warm in cold weather, enabling them to live in cooler climates. fire also kept nocturnal predators at bay. evidence of cooked food is found from 1.9 million years ago, although there is a theory that fire could have been used in a controlled fashion about 1 million years ago. evidence becomes widespread around 50 to 100 thousand years ago, suggesting regular use from this time; resistance to air pollution started to evolve in human populations at a similar point in time. the use of fire became progressively more sophisticated, with it being used to create charcoal and to control wildlife from tens of thousands of years ago.
fire has also been used for centuries as a method of torture and execution, as evidenced by death by burning as well as torture devices such as the iron boot, which could be filled with water, oil, or even lead and then heated over an open fire to the agony of the wearer.
by the neolithic revolution, during the introduction of grain-based agriculture, people all over the world used fire as a tool in landscape management. these fires were typically controlled burns or cool fires, as opposed to uncontrolled hot fires, which damage the soil. hot fires destroy plants and animals, and endanger communities. this is especially a problem in the forests of today where traditional burning is prevented in order to encourage the growth of timber crops. cool fires are generally conducted in the spring and autumn. they clear undergrowth, burning up biomass that could trigger a hot fire should it get too dense. they provide a greater variety of environments, which encourages game and plant diversity. for humans, they make dense, impassable forests traversable. another human use for fire in regards to landscape management is its use to clear land for agriculture. slash-and-burn agriculture is still common across much of tropical africa, asia and south america. for small farmers, it is a convenient way to clear overgrown areas and release nutrients from standing vegetation back into the soil, said miguel pinedo-vasquez, an ecologist at the earth institute’s center for environmental research and conservation. however this useful strategy is also problematic. growing population, fragmentation of forests and warming climate are making the earth's surface more prone to ever-larger escaped fires. these harm ecosystems and human infrastructure, cause health problems, and send up spirals of carbon and soot that may encourage even more warming of the atmosphere–and thus feed back into more fires. globally today, as much as 5 million square kilometers–an area more than half the size of the united states–burns in a given year.
there are numerous modern applications of fire. in its broadest sense, fire is used by nearly every human being on earth in a controlled setting every day. users of internal combustion vehicles employ fire every time they drive. thermal power stations provide electricity for a large percentage of humanity. the use of fire in warfare has a long history. fire was the basis of all early thermal weapons. homer detailed the use of fire by greek soldiers who hid in a wooden horse to burn troy during the trojan war. later the byzantine fleet used greek fire to attack ships and men. in the first world war, the first modern flamethrowers were used by infantry, and were successfully mounted on armoured vehicles in the second world war. in the latter war, incendiary bombs were used by axis and allies alike, notably on tokyo, rotterdam, london, hamburg and, notoriously, at dresden; in the latter two cases firestorms were deliberately caused in which a ring of fire surrounding each city was drawn inward by an updraft caused by a central cluster of fires. the united states army air force also extensively used incendiaries against japanese targets in the latter months of the war, devastating entire cities constructed primarily of wood and paper houses. the use of napalm was employed in july 1944, towards the end of the second world war; although its use did not gain public attention until the vietnam war. molotov cocktails were also used. use as fuel setting fuel aflame releases usable energy. wood was a prehistoric fuel, and is still viable today. the use of fossil fuels, such as petroleum, natural gas, and coal, in power plants supplies the vast majority of the world's electricity today; the international energy agency states that nearly 80% of the world's power comes from these sources. the fire in a power station is used to heat water, creating steam that drives turbines. the turbines then spin an electric generator to produce electricity. fire is also used to provide mechanical work directly, in both external and internal combustion engines.
the unburnable solid remains of a combustible material left after a fire is called clinker if its melting point is below the flame temperature, so that it fuses and then solidifies as it cools, and ash if its melting point is above the flame temperature. protection and prevention wildfire prevention programs around the world may employ techniques such as wildland fire use and prescribed or controlled burns. wildland fire use refers to any fire of natural causes that is monitored but allowed to burn. controlled burns are fires ignited by government agencies under less dangerous weather conditions.
fire fighting services are provided in most developed areas to extinguish or contain uncontrolled fires. trained firefighters use fire apparatus, water supply resources such as water mains and fire hydrants or they might use a and b class foam depending on what is feeding the fire.
fire prevention is intended to reduce sources of ignition. fire prevention also includes education to teach people how to avoid causing fires. buildings, especially schools and tall buildings, often conduct fire drills to inform and prepare citizens on how to react to a building fire. purposely starting destructive fires constitutes arson and is a crime in most jurisdictions.
model building codes require passive fire protection and active fire protection systems to minimize damage resulting from a fire. the most common form of active fire protection is fire sprinklers. to maximize passive fire protection of buildings, building materials and furnishings in most developed countries are tested for fire-resistance, combustibility and flammability. upholstery, carpeting and plastics used in vehicles and vessels are also tested.
where fire prevention and fire protection have failed to prevent damage, fire insurance can mitigate the financial impact. restoration different restoration methods and measures are used depending on the type of fire damage that occurred. restoration after fire damage can be performed by property management teams, building maintenance personnel, or by the homeowners themselves; however, contacting a certified professional fire damage restoration specialist is often regarded as the safest way to restore fire damaged property due to their training and extensive experience. most are usually listed under fire and water restoration and they can help speed repairs, whether for individual homeowners or for the largest of institutions.
fire and water restoration companies are regulated by the appropriate state's department of consumer affairs – usually the state contractors license board. in california, all fire and water restoration companies must register with the california contractors state license board. presently, the california contractors state license board has no specific classification for water and fire damage restoration. hence, the contractor's state license board requires both an asbestos certification (asb) as well as a demolition classification (c-21) in order to perform fire and water restoration work. see also references bibliography karki, sameer (2002). community involvement in and management of forest fires in south east asia (pdf). project firefight south east asia. archived from the original (pdf) on february 25, 2009. retrieved 2009-02-13. haung, kai. 2009. population and building factors that impact residential fire rates in large u.s. cities. applied research project. texas state university. txstate.edu

a sea is a large body of salt water that is surrounded in whole or in part by land. more broadly, the sea is the interconnected system of earth's salty, oceanic waters—considered as one global ocean or as several principal oceanic divisions. the sea moderates earth's climate and has important roles in the water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle. although the sea has been traveled and explored since prehistory, the modern scientific study of the sea—oceanography—dates broadly to the british challenger expedition of the 1870s. the sea is conventionally divided into up to five large oceanic sections—including the international hydrographic organization's four named oceans (the atlantic, pacific, indian, and arctic) and the southern ocean; smaller, second-order sections, such as the mediterranean, are known as seas.
owing to the present state of continental drift, the northern hemisphere is now fairly equally divided between land and sea (a ratio of about 2:3) but the south is overwhelmingly oceanic (1:4.7). salinity in the open ocean is generally in a narrow band around 3.5% by mass, although this can vary in more landlocked waters, near the mouths of large rivers, or at great depths. about 85% of the solids in the open sea are sodium chloride. deep-sea currents are produced by differences in salinity and temperature. surface currents are formed by the friction of waves produced by the wind and by tides, the changes in local sea level produced by the gravity of the moon and sun. the direction of all of these is governed by surface and submarine land masses and by the rotation of the earth (the coriolis effect).
former changes in sea levels have left continental shelves, shallow areas in the sea close to land. these nutrient-rich waters teem with life, which provide humans with substantial supplies of food—mainly fish, but also shellfish, mammals, and seaweed—which are both harvested in the wild and farmed. the most diverse areas surround great tropical coral reefs. whaling in the deep sea was once common but whales' dwindling numbers prompted international conservation efforts and finally a moratorium on most commercial hunting. oceanography has established that not all life is restricted to the sunlit surface waters: even under enormous depths and pressures, nutrients streaming from hydrothermal vents support their own unique ecosystem. life may have started there and aquatic microbial mats are generally credited with the oxygenation of earth's atmosphere; both plants and animals first evolved in the sea.
the sea is an essential aspect of human trade, travel, mineral extraction, and power generation. this has also made it essential to warfare and left major cities exposed to earthquakes and volcanoes from nearby faults; powerful tsunami waves; and hurricanes, typhoons, and cyclones produced in the tropics. this importance and duality has affected human culture, from early sea gods to the epic poetry of homer to the changes induced by the columbian exchange, from burial at sea to basho's haikus to hyperrealist marine art, and inspiring music ranging from the shanties in the complaynt of scotland to rimsky-korsakov's the sea and sinbad's ship to a-mei's listen to the sea. it is the scene of leisure activities including swimming, diving, surfing, and sailing. however, population growth, industrialization, and intensive farming have all contributed to present-day marine pollution. atmospheric carbon dioxide is being absorbed in increasing amounts, lowering its ph in a process known as ocean acidification. the shared nature of the sea has made overfishing an increasing problem. definition both senses of sea date to old english; the larger sense has required a definite article since early middle english. as the term has been applied over time, there are no sharp distinctions between seas and oceans, although seas are smaller and are usually bounded by land masses (and ones smaller scale than continents), the singular standard exception being the sargasso sea, which is created by the four currents bounding what is termed the north atlantic gyre. seas are generally larger than lakes and contain salt water. while the defining elements of size and being bounded are generally used, there is no formally accepted technical definition of sea among oceanographers. in international law, the united nations convention on the law of the sea states that all the ocean is the sea. physical science earth is the only known planet with seas of liquid water on its surface, although mars possesses ice caps and similar planets in other solar systems may have oceans. it is still unclear where earth's water came from, but, seen from space, our planet appears as a blue marble of its various forms: oceans, ice caps, clouds. earth's 1,335,000,000 cubic kilometers (320,000,000 cu mi) of sea contain about 97.2 percent of its known water and cover more than 70 percent of its surface. another 2.15% of earth's water is frozen, found in the sea ice covering the arctic ocean, the ice cap covering antarctica and its adjacent seas, and various glaciers and surface deposits around the world. the remainder (about 0.65% of the whole) form underground reservoirs or various stages of the water cycle, containing the freshwater encountered and used by most terrestrial life: vapor in the air, the clouds it slowly forms, the rain falling from them, and the lakes and rivers spontaneously formed as its waters flow again and again to the sea. the sea's dominance of the planet is such that the british author arthur c. clarke once noted that earth would have been better named ocean.
the scientific study of water and earth's water cycle is hydrology; hydrodynamics studies the physics of water in motion. the more recent study of the sea in particular is oceanography. this began as the study of the shape of the ocean's currents but has since expanded into a large and multidisciplinary field: it examines the properties of seawater; studies waves, tides, and currents; charts coastlines and maps the seabeds; and studies marine life. the subfield dealing with the sea's motion, its forces, and the forces acting upon it is known as physical oceanography. marine biology (biological oceanography) studies the plants, animals, and other organisms inhabiting marine ecosystems. both are informed by chemical oceanography, which studies the behavior of elements and molecules within the oceans: particularly, at the moment, the ocean's role in the carbon cycle and carbon dioxide's role in the increasing acidification of seawater. marine and maritime geography charts the shape and shaping of the sea, while marine geology (geological oceanography) has provided evidence of continental drift and the composition and structure of the earth, clarified the process of sedimentation, and assisted the study of volcanism and earthquakes. seawater seawater is invariably salty and, although its degree of saltiness (salinity) can vary, about 90% of the water in the ocean has 34–35 g (1.2 oz.) of dissolved solids per liter, producing a salinity between 3.4 and 3.5%. to easily describe small differences, however, oceanographers usually express salinity as a millage (‰) or part per thousand (ppt) instead of using percents. the surface salinity of waters in the northern hemisphere are generally closer to the 34‰ mark, while those in the south are closer to 35‰. the solutes in ocean water come both from inflowing river water and from the ocean floor. the relative composition of the solutes is stable throughout the world's oceans: sodium (na) and chloride (cl) make up about 85%. other solutes include metal ions such as magnesium (mg) and calcium (ca) and negative ions such as sulfate (so₄), carbonate (co₃), and bromides. in the absence of other pollution, seawater would not be harmful to drink except that it is much too saline; similarly, it cannot be used for irrigating most plants without being desalinated. for scientific and technical purposes, a standardized form of artificial seawater is often used.
variations in salinity are caused by many factors: currents flowing between the seas; incoming freshwater from rivers and glaciers; precipitation; the formation and melting of sea ice; and evaporation, which is in turn affected by temperature, winds, and waves. for example, the upper level of the baltic sea has a very low salinity (10 to 15‰) because the low temperatures of the surrounding climate produce minimal evaporation; it has many inflowing rivers; and its small connection to the north sea tends to create a cold, dense under-layer that hardly mixes with the surface waters. by contrast, the red sea lies between the sahara and arabian deserts; it has high evaporation but little precipitation; it has few (and mostly seasonal) inflowing rivers; and its connection to other seas—the suez canal in the north and the bab-el-mandeb in the south—are both very narrow. its salinity averages 40‰. the mediterranean is a little lower, at 37‰, while some landlocked lakes are much higher: the dead sea has 300 grams (11 oz) of dissolved solids per liter (300‰). sea temperature chiefly depends on the amount of solar radiation it absorbs. in the tropics where sunlight falls more directly, the temperature of the surface layers can rise to over 30 °c (86 °f); near the poles, the temperature is in equilibrium with the sea ice at its freezing point. its salinity makes this lower than freshwater's, usually about −1.8 °c (28.8 °f). these temperature differences contribute to the continuous circulation of water through the sea. warm surface currents cool as they move away from the tropics; as the water becomes denser, it sinks. the cold water in the deep sea moves back towards the equator before welling up again to the surface. deep seawater has a temperature between −2 and 5 °c (28 and 41 °f) in all parts of the globe. in freezing seas, ice crystals begin to form on the surface. these break into small pieces and coalesce into flat discs that form a thick suspension known as frazil. in calm conditions, frazil will freeze into a thin, flat sheet called nilas, which thickens as new ice forms in the sea beneath it. in turbulent waters, frazil instead join together into larger flat discs known as pancakes. these slide over and under one another to form floes. during these processes, salt water and air are trapped amid the ice. nilas forms with a salinity around 12–15‰ and is grayish in color but grows fresher over time: after a year, it is bluish and closer to 4–6‰ saline. the amount of light that penetrates the sea depends on the angle of the sun, the local weather, and the sea's turbidity. of the light that reaches the surface of the sea, much of it is reflected at the surface and its red wavelengths are absorbed in the top few meters. yellow and green reach greater depths, and the longer blue and violet wavelengths may penetrate as deep as 1,000 m (3,300 ft).
the amount of oxygen present in seawater depends primarily upon its temperature and the photosynthetic organisms living in it, particularly algae, phytoplankton, and plants such as seagrass. during the day, their photosynthetic activity produces oxygen, which dissolves into the seawater and is used by marine animals. the water's oxygen saturation is lower during the night and much lower in the deep sea. below a depth of about 200 m (660 ft), there is insufficient light for photosynthesis and consequently little dissolved oxygen. below this, anaerobic bacteria break down falling organic material, producing hydrogen sulfide (h₂s). it is projected that global warming will reduce oxygen both in surface and deep waters, due to oxygen's decreased solubility as temperatures increase and increased oceanic stratification. waves ocean surface waves are propagating oscillations caused by the drag and friction from air moving across the surface of the water. this friction transfers energy and forms surface waves in the water more or less in the direction of the wind. the top of a wave is known as its crest and its foot as its trough; the distance between two crests is the wavelength. these waves are mechanical: as they approach, the water at a given point rise up and, as they pass, the water goes down, with parcels of water tracing a roughly circular path. the energy is passed along with the wave at a much greater speed than the motion of the water itself.
the sea state of the ocean is determined by the size of these waves, which—on the open ocean—depends upon the wind speed and the fetch, the distance over which the wind blows upon the water. the smallest waves are called ripples, strongly affected by surface tension. as strong and prolonged winds push against ripples' raised crests, larger and more irregular waves form, which are known as seas. these waves reach their maximum height when the rate at which they are traveling nearly matches the speed of the wind. as the wind drops, the waves remain as swell and, over time, they naturally separate into long, powerful waves with a common direction and wavelength. these swells can travel over large distances—even half the globe—and originate particularly often from the roaring forties of the southern hemisphere where the wind blows continuously. when the wind dies down, ripples easily disappear owing to water's internal friction (viscosity), but longer waves in seas and swells are only (very) slowly reduced by viscosity. constructive interference, however, can also cause individual (unexpected) rogue waves much higher than normal. most waves are less than 3 m (10 ft) high and it is not unusual for strong storms to double or triple that height; offshore construction such as wind farms and oil platforms use metocean statistics from measurements in computing the wave forces (due to for instance the hundred-year wave) they are designed against. rogue waves, however, have been documented at heights above 25 meters (82 ft). as waves approach land and move into shallow water, they change their behavior. if approaching at an angle, waves may bend (refraction) or wrap rocks and headlands (diffraction). when the wave reaches a point where its deepest oscillations of the water contact the seabed, they begin to slow down. this pulls the crests closer together and increases the waves' height, which is called wave shoaling. when the ratio of the wave's height to the water depth increases above a certain limit, it breaks, toppling over in a mass of foaming water. this rushes in a sheet up the beach before retreating into the sea under the influence of gravity. tsunami a tsunami is an unusual form of wave caused by a sudden and powerful event such as an underwater earthquake or landslide, a meteorite impact, a volcanic eruption, or a collapse of land into the sea. these events can temporarily lift or lower the surface of the sea in the affected area, usually by a few feet. the potential energy of the displaced seawater is turned into kinetic energy, creating a shallow wave radiating outwards at a velocity proportional to the square root of the depth of the water. tsunamis, therefore, travel much faster in the open ocean than on a continental shelf. despite traveling at speeds of over 600 mph (970 km/h), tsunamis in deep seas have wavelengths from 80 to 300 miles (130 to 480 km) and an amplitude of less than three feet. standard surface waves in the same region may only have wavelengths of a few hundred feet and speeds up to 65 mph (105 km/h) but, when compared to their possible amplitudes of up to 45 ft (14 m), tsunamis at this stage are often able to pass unnoticed. tsunami warning systems rely on the fact that seismic waves caused by earthquakes travel around the world at around 14,400 kilometers (8,900 mi) per hour, allowing threatened regions to be alerted to the possibility of a tsunami. measurements from a network of sea-level measuring stations make it possible to confirm or cancel a tsunami warning. a trigger event on the continental shelf may cause a local tsunami on the land side and a distant tsunami that travels out across the ocean. the energy of the wave is dissipated only gradually but is spread out over the wave front. as the wave radiates away from the source, the front gets longer and the average energy reduces, so distant shores will generally be hit by weaker waves. however, as the speed of the wave is controlled by the water depth, it does not travel at the same speed in all directions and this affects the direction of the wave front. this effect, known as refraction, can focus the strength of an advancing tsunami on some areas while weakening it in others, according to the undersea topography along its path.
just as with other waves, moving into shallow water causes the tsunami to slow but grow in height. either the trough or the crest of the tsunami can arrive at the coast first. in the former case, the sea draws back and leaves subtidal areas unusually exposed. when the crest arrives, it does not usually break but rushes inland, flooding all in its path. much of the disaster's destruction can be produced by these flood waters, which drain back into the sea while pulling people and debris along. several tsunamis can be caused by a single geological event. in such cases, it is common for the later waves to arrive between eight minutes and two hours after the first, which may not be the biggest or most destructive. occasionally, in a shallow bay or estuary, a tsunami may transform into a bore. tides tides are the regular rise and fall in water level experienced by seas and oceans in response to the gravitational influences of the moon and the sun, and the effects of the earth's rotation. at any given place, the water rises over the course of the tidal cycle to a maximum height known as high tide before ebbing away again to a minimum low tide level. as the water recedes, it uncovers more and more of the foreshore or intertidal zone. the difference in height between the high tide and low tide is known as the tidal range or tidal amplitude. tidal bores can occur at the mouths of rivers, where the force of the incoming tide pushes waves of seawater upstream against the current. at hangzhou in china, the bore can reach 9 meters (30 ft) high and travel up to 40 km (25 mi) per hour.
most places experience two high tides each day, occurring at intervals of about 12 hours and 25 minutes, half the period that it takes for the earth to make a complete revolution and return the moon to its previous position relative to an observer. the moon's mass is some 27 million times smaller than the sun, but it is 400 times closer to the earth. tidal force or tide-raising force decreases rapidly with distance, so the moon has more than twice as great an effect on tides as the sun. a bulge is formed in the ocean at the place where the earth is closest to the moon, because it is also where the effect of the moon's gravity is stronger. on the opposite side of the earth, the lunar force is at its weakest and this causes another bulge to form. these bulges rotate around the earth as the moon does. the sun's effect is less powerful but, when the sun, moon and earth are all aligned at the full and new moons, the combined effect results in the high spring tides. in contrast, when the sun is at 90° from the moon as viewed from earth, the combined gravitational effect on tides is correspondingly reduced, causing the lower neap tides.
tidal flows of seawater are resisted by the water's inertia and can be affected by land masses. in places like the gulf of mexico where land constrains the movement of the bulges, only one set of tides may occur each day. inshore from an island, there may be a complex daily cycle with four high tides. the island straits at chalkis on euboea experience strong currents which abruptly switch direction, generally four times per day but up to 12 times per day when the moon and the sun are 90 degrees apart. where there is a funnel-shaped bay or estuary, the tidal range can be magnified. the bay of fundy in canada can experience spring tides of 15 m (49 ft). although tides are regular and predictable, the height of high tides can be lowered by offshore winds and raised by onshore winds. the high pressure at the center of an anticyclones pushes down on the water and is associated with abnormally low tides while low-pressure areas may cause extremely high tides. a storm surge can occur when high winds pile water up against the coast in a shallow area and this, coupled with a low pressure system, can raise the surface of the sea at high tide dramatically. in 1900, galveston, texas, experienced a 15 ft (5 m) surge during a hurricane that overwhelmed the city, killing over 3,500 people and destroying 3,636 homes. currents wind blowing over the surface of the sea causes friction at the interface between air and sea. not only does this cause waves to form but it also makes the surface seawater move in the same direction as the wind. although winds are variable, in any one place they predominantly blow from a single direction and thus a surface current can be formed. westerly winds are most frequent in the mid-latitudes while easterlies dominate the tropics. when water moves in this way, other water flows in to fill the gap and a circular movement of surface currents known as a gyre is formed. there are five main gyres in the world's oceans: two in the pacific, two in the atlantic, and one in the indian ocean. the north atlantic gyre that produces the sargasso sea accumulates salinity levels as high as 38‰. other smaller gyres are found in lesser seas and a single gyre flows around antarctica. these gyres have followed the same routes for millennia, guided by the topography of the land, the wind direction, and the coriolis effect. the surface currents flow in a clockwise direction in the northern hemisphere and anticlockwise in the southern hemisphere. the water moving away from the equator is warm, while that flowing towards it has lost most of its heat. these currents tend to moderate the earth's climate, cooling the equatorial region, and warming regions at higher latitudes. global climate and weather forecasts are powerfully affected by the world ocean, so global climate modelling makes use of ocean circulation models as well as models of other major components such as the atmosphere, land surfaces, aerosols, and sea ice. ocean models make use of a branch of physics, geophysical fluid dynamics, that describes the large-scale flow of fluids such as seawater. surface currents only affect the top few hundred meters (yards) of the sea, but there are also large-scale flows in the ocean depths caused by the movement of deep water masses. a main deep ocean current flows through all the world's oceans and is known as the thermohaline circulation or global conveyor belt. this movement is slow and is driven by differences in density of the water caused by variations in salinity and temperature. at high latitudes, the water is chilled by the low atmospheric temperature and becomes saltier as sea ice crystallizes out. both these factors make it denser and the water sinks. from the deep sea near greenland, such water flows southwards between the continental landmasses on either side of the atlantic. when it reaches the antarctic, it is joined by further masses of cold, sinking water and flows eastwards. it then splits into two streams that move northwards into the indian and pacific oceans. here it is gradually warmed, becomes less dense, rises towards the surface, and loops back on itself. some flows back into the atlantic. it takes a thousand years for this circulation pattern to be completed. besides gyres, there are temporary surface currents that occur under specific conditions. when waves meet a shore at an angle, a longshore current is created as water is pushed along parallel to the coastline. the water swirls up onto the beach at right angles to the approaching waves but drains away straight down the slope under the effect of gravity. the larger the breaking waves, the longer the beach, and the more oblique the wave's approach, the stronger the longshore current is. these currents can shift great volumes of sand or pebbles, create spits, and make beaches disappear and water channels silt up. a rip current can occur when water piles up near the shore from advancing waves and is funnelled out to sea through a channel in the seabed. it may occur at a gap in a sandbar or near a man-made structure such as a groyne. these strong currents can have a velocity of 1 m/s (3.3 ft/s), can form at different places at different stages of the tide, and can carry away unwary swimmers. temporary upwelling currents occur when the wind pushes water away from the land and deeper water rises to replace it. this cold water is often rich in nutrients and creates blooms of phytoplankton and a great increase in the productivity of the sea. basins bathymetry is the mapping and study of the topography of the ocean floor. methods used for measuring the depth of the sea include single or multibeam echosounders, laser airborne depth sounders and the calculation of depths from satellite remote sensing data. this information is used for determining the routes of undersea cables and pipelines, for choosing suitable locations for siting oil rigs and offshore wind turbines and for identifying possible new fisheries. the earth is composed of a magnetic central core, a mostly liquid mantle, and a hard rigid outer shell (or lithosphere), which is composed of the earth's rocky crust and the deeper and mostly solid outer layer of the mantle. the crust below land is known as continental while that under the abyssal sea is called oceanic. the latter is composed of relatively dense basalt and is some five to ten kilometers (three to six miles) thick. the relatively thin lithosphere floats on the weaker and hotter mantle below and is fractured into a number of tectonic plates. in mid-ocean, magma is constantly being thrust through the seabed between adjoining plates to form mid-oceanic ridges and here convection currents within the mantle tend to drive the two plates apart. parallel to these ridges and nearer the coasts, one oceanic plate may slide beneath another oceanic plate in a process known as subduction. deep trenches are formed here and the process is accompanied by friction as the plates grind together. the movement proceeds in jerks which cause earthquakes. heat is also produced and magma is forced up, creating underwater mountains, some of which grow into volcanic islands. near some boundaries between the land and sea, the slightly denser oceanic plates slide beneath the continental plates and more subduction trenches are formed. as they grate together, the continental plates are deformed and buckle causing mountain building and seismic activity.
the earth's deepest trench is the mariana trench which extends for about 2,500 kilometers (1,600 mi) across the seabed. it is near the mariana islands, a volcanic archipelago in the west pacific. though it averages just 68 km (42 mi) wide, its deepest point is 10.994 kilometers (nearly 7 miles) below the surface of the sea. an even longer trench runs alongside the coast of peru and chile, reaching a depth of 8,065 m (26,460 ft) and extending for approximately 5,900 km (3,700 mi). it occurs where the oceanic nazca plate slides under the continental south american plate and is associated with the upthrust and volcanic activity of the andes. coasts the zone where land meets sea is known as the coast and the part between the lowest spring tides and the upper limit reached by splashing waves is the shore. a beach is the accumulation of sand or shingle on the shore. a headland is a point of land jutting out into the sea and a larger promontory is known as a cape. the indentation of a coastline—especially between two headlands—is a bay; a small bay with a narrow inlet is a cove and a large bay or bay-shaped sea may be referred to as a gulf. coastlines are influenced by a number of factors including the strength of the waves arriving on the shore, the gradient of the land margin, the composition and hardness of the coastal rock, the inclination of the off-shore slope, and the changes of the level of the land due to local uplift or submergence. normally, waves roll towards the shore at the rate of six to eight per minute. these are known as constructive waves as they tend to move material up the beach and have little erosive effect. storm waves arrive on shore in rapid succession and are known as destructive waves, as their swash moves beach material seawards. under their influence, the sand and shingle on the beach is ground together and abraded. around high tide, the power of a storm wave impacting on the foot of a cliff has a shattering effect as air in cracks and crevices is compressed and then expands rapidly with release of pressure. at the same time, sand and pebbles have an erosive effect as they are thrown against the rocks. along with other weathering processes such as frost, this tends to undercut the cliff. gradually, a wave-cut platform develops at the foot of the cliff and this has a protective effect, reducing further wave-erosion.
material worn from the margins of the land eventually ends up in the sea, where it is subject to attrition as currents flowing parallel to the coast scour out channels and transport material away from its place of origin. sediment carried to the sea by rivers settles on the seabed causing deltas to form in estuaries. all these materials move back and forth under the influence of waves, tides, and currents. dredging removes material and deepens channels but may have unexpected effects elsewhere on the coastline. governments make efforts to prevent flooding through building breakwaters, seawalls, and other defenses against the sea. in britain, the thames barrier protects london from storm surges, while the failure of the dykes and levees around new orleans during hurricane katrina created a humanitarian crisis in the united states. land reclamation in hong kong permitted the construction of hong kong international airport through the leveling and expansion of two smaller islands.
following the adoption of the present unclos, the coastline under international law is a state's baseline, which is generally but not always equivalent to its low-water line. sea level over most of geologic time, the sea level has been higher than it is today. the main factor affecting sea level over time is the result of changes in the oceanic crust, with a downward trend expected to continue in the very long term. at the last glacial maximum some 20,000 years ago, the sea level was 120 meters (390 ft) below its present-day level. for at least the last 100 years, the sea level has been rising at an average rate of about 1.8 mm (0.071 in) per year. most of this rise can be attributed to an increase in the temperature of the sea and the resulting slight thermal expansion of the upper 500 m (1,600 ft) of water. additional contributions, as much as one quarter of the total, come from water sources on land, such as melting snow and glaciers and extraction of groundwater for irrigation and other agricultural and human needs. the rising trend from global warming is expected to continue until at least the end of the 21st century. the water cycle the sea plays a part in the water cycle, in which water evaporates from the ocean, travels through the atmosphere as vapor, condenses, falls (usually as rain or snow) again, and then largely returns to the sea. even in the atacama desert, where little rain ever falls, dense clouds of fog known as the camanchaca blow in from the sea and support plant life. in large land masses, geologic features can block the access of some regions to the main sea. these endorheic basins, particularly in central asia, sometimes build up permanent salt lakes as inflowing waters evaporate and their dissolved minerals accumulate over time. the largest of these is the caspian sea, although it is sometimes counted as a proper sea owing to its basin of (now-landlocked) oceanic crust. other notable examples include the aral sea in central asia and the great salt lake in the western united states. the waters of these basins still eventually return to the sea through evaporation, the flow of ground water, and (over geologic time) the opening up of the basins by continental drift. the carbon cycle oceans contain the greatest quantity of actively-cycled carbon in the world and are second only to the lithosphere in the amount of carbon they store. the oceans' surface layer holds large amounts of dissolved organic carbon that is exchanged rapidly with the atmosphere. the deep layer's concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon is about 15 percent higher than that of the surface layer and it remains there for much longer periods of time. thermohaline circulation exchanges carbon between these two layers.
carbon enters the ocean as atmospheric carbon dioxide dissolves into the surface layers and is converted into carbonic acid, carbonate, and bicarbonate: co2 (aq) + h2o ⇌ h2co3 ⇌ hco3− + h+ ⇌ co32− + 2 h+. the process liberates hydrogen ions (h+), decreasing ocean ph and increasing its acidity.
it can also enter as dissolved organic carbon through rivers and is converted by photosynthetic organisms into organic carbon. this can either be exchanged throughout the food chain or precipitated into the deeper, more carbon-rich layers as dead soft tissue or in shells and bones as calcium carbonate. it circulates in this layer for long periods of time before either being deposited as sediment or being returned to surface waters through thermohaline circulation. acidification seawater is slightly alkaline and had a preindustrial ph of about 8.2. more recently, anthropogenic activities have steadily increased the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere; about 30–40% of the added co2 is absorbed by the oceans, forming carbonic acid and lowering the ph (now below 8.1) through a process called ocean acidification. the ph is expected to reach 7.7 (representing a 3-fold increase in hydrogen ion concentration) by the year 2100, which is a significant change in a century.
one important element for the formation of skeletal material in marine animals is calcium, but calcium carbonate becomes more soluble with pressure, so carbonate shells and skeletons dissolve below its compensation depth. calcium carbonate also becomes more soluble at lower ph, so ocean acidification is likely to have profound effects on marine organisms with calcareous shells, such as oysters, clams, sea urchins, and corals, because their ability to form shells will be reduced, and the carbonate compensation depth will rise closer to the sea surface. affected planktonic organisms will include the snail-like molluscs known as pteropods, and single-celled algae called coccolithophorids and foraminifera. all of these are important parts of the food chain and a diminution in their numbers will have significant consequences. in tropical regions, corals are likely to be severely affected as it becomes more difficult to build their calcium carbonate skeletons, in turn adversely impacting other reef dwellers.
the current rate of ocean chemistry change appears to be without precedent in earth's geological history, making it unclear how well marine ecosystems will be able to adapt to the shifting conditions of the near future. of particular concern is the manner in which the combination of acidification with the expected additional stressors of higher temperatures and lower oxygen levels will impact the seas. marine life the oceans are home to a diverse collection of life forms that use it as a habitat. since sunlight illuminates only the upper layers, the major part of the ocean exists in permanent darkness. as the different depth and temperature zones each provide habitat for a unique set of species, the marine environment as a whole encompasses an immense diversity of life. marine habitats range from surface water to the deepest oceanic trenches, including coral reefs, kelp forests, seagrass meadows, tidepools, muddy, sandy and rocky seabeds, and the open pelagic zone. the organisms living in the sea range from whales 30 meters (100 ft) long to microscopic phytoplankton and zooplankton, fungi, bacteria and viruses, including recently discovered marine bacteriophages which live parasitically inside bacteria. marine life plays an important part in the carbon cycle as photosynthetic organisms convert dissolved carbon dioxide into organic carbon and it is economically important to humans for providing fish for use as food.
life may have originated in the sea and all the major groups of animals are represented there. scientists differ as to precisely where in the sea life arose: the miller-urey experiments suggested a dilute chemical soup in open water, but more recent suggestions include volcanic hot springs, fine-grained clay sediments, or deep-sea black smoker vents, all of which would have provided protection from damaging ultraviolet radiation which was not blocked by the early earth's atmosphere. habitats marine habitats can be divided horizontally into coastal and open ocean habitats. coastal habitats extend from the shoreline to the edge of the continental shelf. most marine life is found in coastal habitats, even though the shelf area occupies only 7 percent of the total ocean area. open ocean habitats are found in the deep ocean beyond the edge of the continental shelf. alternatively, marine habitats can be divided vertically into pelagic (open water), demersal (just above the seabed), and benthic (sea bottom) habitats. a third division is by latitude: from tropical to temperate to polar waters.
coral reefs, the so-called rainforests of the sea, occupy less than 0.1 percent of the world's ocean surface, yet their ecosystems include 25 percent of all marine species. the best-known are tropical coral reefs such as australia's great barrier reef, but cold water reefs harbor a wide array of species including corals (only six of which contribute to reef formation). algae and plants marine primary producers—plants and microscopic organisms in the plankton—are widespread and very diverse. microscopic photosynthetic algae, phytoplankton, contribute a larger proportion of the world's photosynthetic output than all the terrestrial forests combined. about 45 percent of the sea's primary production of living material is contributed by diatoms. much larger algae, commonly known as seaweeds, are important locally; sargassum forms floating drifts, while kelp form seabed forests. flowering plants in the form of seagrasses grow in meadows in sandy shallows, mangroves line the coast in tropical and subtropical regions, and salt-tolerant plants thrive in regularly inundated salt marshes. all of these habitats are able to sequester large quantities of carbon and support a biodiverse range of larger and smaller animal life.
light is only able to penetrate the top 200 m (660 ft) so this is the only part of the sea where plants can grow. the surface layers are often deficient in biologically-active nitrogen compounds. the marine nitrogen cycle consists of complex microbial transformations which include the fixation of nitrogen, its assimilation, nitrification, anammox, and denitrification. some of these processes take place in deep water so that where there is an upwelling of cold waters or near estuaries where land-sourced nutrients are present, plant growth is higher. this means that the most productive areas, rich in plankton and therefore also in fish, are mainly coastal. animals and other life there is a broader spectrum of higher animal taxa in the sea than on land, many marine species have yet to be discovered, and the number known to science is expanding annually. some vertebrates such as seabirds, seals, and sea turtles return to the land to breed but fish, cetaceans, and sea snakes have a completely aquatic lifestyle and many invertebrate phyla are entirely marine. in fact, the oceans teem with life and provide many varying microhabitats. one of these is the surface film which—despite being tossed about by the movement of waves—provides a rich environment and is home to bacteria, fungi, microalgae, protozoa, fish eggs, and various larvae.
the pelagic zone contains macro- and microfauna and myriad zooplankton which drift with the currents. most of the smallest organisms are the larvae of fish and marine invertebrates which liberate eggs in vast numbers because the chance of any one embryo surviving to maturity is so minute. the zooplankton feed on phytoplankton and on each other and form a basic part of the complex food chain that extends through variously-sized fish and other nektonic organisms, which are in turn eaten by larger squids, sharks, porpoises, dolphins, and whales. some marine creatures make large migrations, either to other regions of the ocean on a seasonal basis or up and down its vertical layers, often ascending to feed at night before descending to safety by day. ships can introduce or spread invasive species through the discharge of ballast water or through the transport of organisms that have accumulated as part of the fouling community on the hulls of vessels.
the demersal zone supports many animals that feed on benthic organisms or seek protection from predators. the seabed provides a range of habitats on or under the surface of the substrate which are used by creatures adapted to these conditions. the tidal zone with its periodic exposure to dehydrating air is home to barnacles, molluscs, and crustaceans. the neritic zone has many organisms that need light to flourish. here, sponges, echinoderms, polychaete worms, sea anemones, and other invertebrates live among algal-encrusted rocks. corals often contain photosynthetic symbionts and live in shallow waters where light penetrates. the extensive calcareous skeletons they extrude build up into coral reefs which are an important feature of the seabed. these provide a diverse habitat for reef dwelling organisms. there is less sea life on the floor of deeper seas but marine life also flourishes around seamounts that rise from the depths, where fish and other animals congregate to spawn and feed. close to the seabed live demersal fish that largely feed on pelagic organisms or benthic invertebrates. exploration of the deep sea by submersibles revealed a new world of creatures living on the seabed that scientists had not previously expected. some like the detritivores rely on organic material falling to the ocean floor. others cluster round deep-sea hydrothermal vents where mineral-rich flows of water emerge, supporting communities whose primary producers are sulphide-oxidizing chemoautotrophic bacteria and whose consumers include specialized bivalves, sea anemones, barnacles, crabs, worms, and fish. a dead whale sinking to the bottom of the ocean provides food for an assembly of organisms which similarly rely largely on the actions of sulphur-reducing bacteria. such places support unique biomes where many new microbes and other lifeforms have been discovered. humans and the sea navigation and exploration humans have travelled the sea since prehistoric times, originally on rafts and in dugout, reed, and bark canoes. most of the early human migrations occurred over land: even areas now separated by open sea such as the americas, japan, and britain were accessible by land bridges or fast ice during the last ice age. however, the dwarf flores man probably needed to cross a 19-kilometer (12 mi) wide strait from sundaland to reach komodo and, although the exact details remain uncertain, the ancestors of australia's aborigines must have crossed the broader deep-sea wallace line to near oceania tens of thousands of years ago. despite earlier theories, modern bathymetric soundings now suggest that even the earliest settlement of the philippines required crossing deep water at the mindoro strait or the sibutu passage.
the hunter-gatherer ortoiroid people began spreading through the caribbean from venezuela's orinoco valley by at least the 6th millennium bc. around the same time, mesopotamians were using bitumen to caulk their reed boats and, a little later, masted sails. lothal in india boasted the earliest known dock around 2400 bc. by c. 2000 bc, austronesians on taiwan had begun spreading into maritime southeast asia. from 1300 to 900 bc, the austronesian lapita peoples displayed great feats of navigation, reaching out from the bismarck archipelago to as far away as fiji, tonga, and samoa. their descendants continued to travel thousands of miles between tiny islands on outrigger canoes: the austronesians of the sunda islands settled madagascar off southeast africa before ad 500 and the polynesians settled the hawaiian islands before 800, easter island before 1200, and new zealand shortly after. the egyptian pharaoh necho ii initiated construction on a canal which eventually linked the mediterranean and red seas around 600 bc. herodotus records egyptian claims that he also commissioned a 3-year-long expedition which circumnavigated africa from the red sea to the nile delta. around 500 bc, the carthaginian navigator hanno left a detailed periplus of an atlantic journey that reached at least senegal and possibly mount cameroon; and the greek pytheas left another exploring the seas around great britain around 325 bc. the massive 3rd-century bc lighthouse of alexandria was considered one of the seven wonders of the world. in the 2nd century, the alexandrian ptolemy mapped the known world, using the fortunate isles as his prime meridian and including details as distant as the gulf of thailand. a modified form was used by columbus for his voyages.
in the mediaeval era, the vikings used clinker-built ships to colonize iceland, greenland, canada, and russia. a compass showing magnetic north is first attested—in the form of a south-pointing spoon—in the 1st-century chinese lunheng. the first evidence of its use in chinese maritime navigation, however, dates to zhu yu's c. 1115 pingzhou table talks. alexander of neckham's de naturis rerum, the first european mention of a magnetized needle, dates to 1190 and immediately notes its use among sailors. latitude (the ship's position ranging from 0° at the equator to 90° north and south) could be determined by inclinometers—including the astrolabe, sextant, and jacob's staff—measuring the angle between the horizon and heavenly bodies like the sun or moon. accurately determining longitude (the ship's position east or west of some fixed point) proved much harder. in the 15th century, west european mariners—beginning with portugal—started making still longer voyages of exploration, using improvements on translated islamic star charts and a variation on african fishing boats called the caravel. in 1473, lopes gonçalves crossed the equator and disproved the aristotelian notion that a ring of fire would bar exploration of the southern hemisphere. bartolomeu dias rounded the cape of good hope in 1487; in 1498, vasco da gama reached malindi, where a local pilot showed him how to follow the monsoon to india. in 1492, relying on incorrect estimates of the circumference of the earth, the genovese christopher columbus sailed from cadiz to the canaries and thence into the open atlantic in a spanish attempt to reach the orient. instead, he made landfall on an island in the caribbean sea. the resulting columbian exchange introduced potatoes, corn, and chili peppers to the old world while smallpox epidemics devastated the indigenous peoples of the americas. this disruption and depopulation permitted rapid spanish conquests and led to the widespread adoption of african slavery to man lucrative tobacco, sugar, indigo, and cotton plantations. in 1519, juan sebastián elcano completed magellan's spanish expedition to sail around the world. these and other voyages permitted european maps to attain a previously impossible degree of accuracy. in 1538, gerardus mercator devised a map projection conveniently making constant bearings (rhumb lines) straight. in the arctic, in 1594, the dutch captain willem barentsz reached svalbard and the barents sea while, in the south, anthony de la roché crossed the antarctic convergence in 1675 and three separate expeditions—one british, one american, and one russian—all claimed to have discovered antarctica in 1820. not all voyages of discovery originated in western europe. although accurate charting of the coasts of russia only began in the 18th century and the archipelago of severnaya zemlya was not discovered until 1910, novgorodians had been sailing the white sea since at least the 13th century. despite a long-standing preference for autarky, china briefly opened up under the song and mongol yuan dynasties. in the early 15th century, zheng he's fleet of treasure ships repeatedly sailed from ming china with 37,000 men aboard 317 ships, reaching as far as the african coast. chinese exploration, however, was soon curtailed again and finally outlawed. the peoples of east asia were introduced to the true shape of the other continents from the maps of matteo ricci.
meanwhile, the determination of longitude continued to involve approximations and guesswork: its true calculation required an accurate clock which permitted comparison between noon aboard ship and the exact time at a fixed point, such as the royal observatory at greenwich. great britain's longitude prize was effectively awarded in 1773 to the self-educated john harrison for his sea watch of 1761. james cook used a copy of this on his second and third voyages, which studied the pacific and inspired studies from russia, france, the netherlands, and the united states. the completion of a submarine telegraphic cable across the english channel in 1850 and subsequent links of the all red line led to greater interest in the deep sea. earlier ideas that no life could exist below 300 fathoms (550 meters or 1,800 feet) were disproved in 1860 when a mediterranean line failed and was pulled up from depths four times lower, completely encrusted with marine life. michael sars's discovery of living fossils deep in norway's fjords helped spur british efforts including hms challenger’s expedition during the 1870s that effectively created modern oceanography. from 1878 to 1880, the ss vega successfully completed the northeast passage and went on to circumnavigate eurasia for the first time. during the mid-1890s, fridtjof nansen used a specially-designed ship to drift through the northern pack ice, establishing that the arctic was an open sea. in 1898 & 1899, carl chun raised and studied many new life forms from over 4,000 m (13,000 ft) below the surface of the south atlantic.
in the 20th century, the gjøa was the first vessel to accomplish the northwest passage in 1906. from 1921, the international hydrographic organization in monaco has standardized surveying and charting of the sea and, from 1924, the discovery investigations studied whales and mapped the seas around antarctica. the spherical bathysphere was able to descend to 434 meters (1,424 ft) in 1930 on a cable and, in the 1940s, jacques cousteau helped develop the first successful scuba gear and popularize underwater diving. the cold war and oil exploration funded further deep sea research: by 1960, the self-powered trieste could take her crew 10,915 m (35,810 ft) into the mariana trench and a us navy diver in an atmospheric diving suit reached 2,000 feet (610 m) below sea level in 2006.
today, the american global positioning system (gps) enables accurate navigation worldwide using over thirty satellites and message timing so exact as to involve general relativity. ongoing oceanographic research includes marine lifeforms, conservation, the marine environment, the chemistry of the ocean, the studying and modelling of climate dynamics, the air-sea boundary, weather patterns, ocean resources, renewable energy, waves and currents, and the design and development of new tools and technologies for investigating the deep. researchers make use of satellite-based remote sensing for surface waters, with research ships, moored observatories and autonomous underwater vehicles to study and monitor all parts of the sea. trade water-borne trade has been practiced since at least the dawn of civilization, when sumeria was connected to harappan india. around 2000 bc, the minoans of crete established the earliest thalassocracy, a maritime empire heavily dependent upon its trade and naval power. the city-states of the phoenicians and greeks then replaced them in the centuries after 1200 bc, ultimately establishing far-flung colonial empires which spread from the sea of azov to the atlantic coast of morocco. under the romans, commerce continued to thrive. in the first centuries bc, steppe nomads' interruption of india's access to siberian gold caused them to open up maritime routes to malaysia and indonesia, exposing them first to hindu and then muslim traders. with the collapse of the roman empire, european trade dwindled but it continued to flourish elsewhere. the tamil chola dynasty thrived on trade between tang china, the javanese srivijaya empire, and the abbasid caliphate in the west. following further conquests, arabians came to dominate maritime trade in the indian ocean, spreading islam along the east african coast and, eventually, southeast asia. a major effect of the age of discovery was the unification of the world's regional trade networks into a single world market, largely run by and for the european monarchs and the merchants of amsterdam, london, and other atlantic ports. from the 16th to the 19th centuries, about 13 million people were shipped across the atlantic to be sold as slaves in the americas. the hales trophy was an award for the fastest commercial crossing of the atlantic and was won by the ss united states in 1952 for a crossing that took three days, ten hours, and forty minutes.
nowadays, large quantities of goods are transported by sea, especially across the atlantic and around the pacific rim. a major trade route passes through the pillars of hercules, across the mediterranean and the suez canal to the indian ocean and through the straits of malacca; much trade also passes through the english channel. shipping lanes are the routes on the open sea used by cargo vessels, traditionally making use of trade winds and currents. over 60 percent of the world's container traffic is conveyed on the top twenty trade routes. increased melting of arctic ice since 2007 enables ships to travel the northwest passage for some weeks in summer, avoiding the longer routes via the suez canal or the panama canal. shipping is supplemented by air freight, a more expensive process mostly used for particularly valuable or perishable cargoes. seaborne trade carries more than us $4 trillion worth of goods each year.
there are two main kinds of freight, bulk cargo and break bulk or general cargo, most of which is now transported in containers. commodities in the form of liquids, powder or particles are carried loose in the holds of bulk carriers and include oil, grain, coal, ore, scrap metal, sand and gravel. break bulk cargo is usually manufactured goods and is transported in packages, often stacked on pallets. before the arrival of containerization in the 1950s, these goods were loaded, transported and unloaded piecemeal. the use of containers has greatly increased the efficiency and decreased the cost of moving them with most freight now traveling in standard sized, lockable containers loaded on purpose-built container ships at dedicated terminals. freight forwarding firms book cargo, arrange pickup and delivery, and manage documentation. the safety of shipping is regulated by the international maritime organization, based in london and first convened in 1959. its objectives include developing and maintaining a regulatory framework for shipping, maritime safety, environmental concerns, legal matters, technical co-operation and maritime security. fishing spearfishing with barbed harpoons along the sea coast was widespread by the palaeolithic. fish ponds surrounded sumerian temples by 2 500 bc and a chinese classical text credited to the 5th-century bc businessman fan li is the earliest known work on fish farming. a surviving fragment of isidore of charax's 1st-century parthian itinerary describes locals freediving for pearls in the persian gulf, and oppian's 2nd-century halieutics relates the four main greek and roman fishing methods as hook-and-line, netting, passive traps, and trident. traditional fishing boats operate in near-shore waters but, during the late middle ages and early modern period, fishing on the open sea—particularly cod—became important to the economic and naval development of northern europe, new england, and canada. overfishing along the coasts of the north sea spurred the development of deep-sea fishers such as the brixham and otter trawlers, which might serve as motherships for longlining dories; in the 19th century, advances such as rail transport, canning, and refrigeration allowed fishing to become a full-fledged industry. improvements in sonar during the world wars were adapted as fishfinders and, during the 1950s, great factory ships caught and processed as many fish in an hour as earlier trawlers had in a season. by the 1960s, the north atlantic and north pacific fisheries were close to maximal exploitation. after the catch from wild marine fisheries grew from 18 million metric tons (20 million tons) in 1950 to around 85 million metric tons ( 93 1⁄2 million tons) by the late 1980s, it has remained essentially constant since. chinese economic reform led to massive growth of its fishing production, from 7% of the world total in 1961 to 35% by 2010. scientific studies of population dynamics and nationalization of formerly shared waters are both helping to cope with overexploitation but the success of modern commercial fishing has required major corrective actions: the collapse of the grand banks cod fishery to less than 1% of its historic levels required a complete moratorium by canada in 1992 and china has enforced a zero-growth policy in its wild catch since 2000, redirecting its industry towards aquaculture; its annual months-long bans on fishing in disputed areas of the south china sea is enforced over the protest of neighboring states. as of 2006, there were an estimated 43.5 million people involved in capturing or raising seafood, 85.5% of whom lived in asia. about   3⁄4 were fishers and the remainder fish farmers. in 2012, total global production of fish, crustaceans, molluscs, and other aquatic animals was a record 158 million metric tons (174 million tons), of which 91.3 million metric tons (100 million tons) were caught in the wild. this is also a record if ignoring the peruvian anchovy, whose population can vary dramatically with the el niño cycle. the overall trend remains increasing, but due to expanding aquaculture in inland waters and mariculture in the sea rather than higher catches in the wild. the exclusive economic zones around coastal countries under the unclos regime have permitted states to institute quota and other management systems over the most productive regions of the sea, accounting for around 87% of the annual harvest. the results are sometimes dramatic—the lull in fishing over the course of the first world war saw the north sea's 1919 catch double 1913's—and sometimes much less so: two decades on, the levels of cod in the grand banks remain only 10% of their peak. at present, the species most frequently landed are herring, cod, anchovy, tuna, flounder, mullet, squid, and salmon. a number of these, as well as large predatory fish, remain well below historical levels. over 3 million vessels are employed in sea fishing. modern fishing vessels include fishing trawlers with a small crew, stern trawlers, purse seiners, long-line factory vessels, and large factory ships which are designed to stay at sea for weeks, processing and freezing great quantities of fish. the equipment used to capture the fish may be purse seines, other seines, trawls, dredges, gillnets, and long-lines. the food and agriculture organization of the united nations is encouraging the development of local fisheries to provide food security to coastal communities and help alleviate poverty. as well as the wild stock, about 79 million metric tons (87 million tons) of food and non-food products were produced by sea farming in 2010, an all-time high. about six hundred species of plants and animals were cultured, some for use in seeding wild populations. the animals raised included finfish, aquatic reptiles, crustaceans, molluscs, sea cucumbers, sea urchins, sea squirts, and jellyfish. integrated mariculture has the advantage that there is a readily-available supply of planktonic food and waste is removed naturally; in cases where the waste would otherwise be harmful, multi-species techniques can used to, e.g., feed farmed shellfish from the waste being produced by farmed salmon. various methods are employed. mesh enclosures for finfish can be suspended in the open seas, cages can be used in more sheltered waters, or ponds can be refreshed with water at each high tide. shrimps can be reared in shallow ponds connected to the open sea. ropes can be hung in water to grow algae, oysters, and mussels. oysters can be reared on trays or in mesh tubes. sea cucumbers can be ranched on the seabed. captive breeding programmes have raised lobster larvae for release of juveniles into the wild resulting in an increased lobster harvest in maine. at least 145 species of seaweed—red, green, and brown algae—are eaten worldwide, some long farmed in japan and other asian countries; there is great potential for additional algaculture. few maritime flowering plants are widely used for food but one example is marsh samphire, which is eaten both raw and cooked. a major difficulty for aquaculture is the tendency towards monoculture and the associated risk of widespread disease. in the 1990s, disease wiped out china's farmed farrer's scallop and white shrimp and required their replacement by other species. shrimp farming has also caused the destruction of important mangrove forests throughout southeast asia. law admiralty law is the particular body of national laws applied to maritime questions and offenses, as the uncertainty of sea voyages has caused the sea to be viewed as a unique jurisdiction since antiquity. rhodian, roman, byzantine, trani, and amalfian laws were important influences on the french, genovese, and hanseatic codes which established the first english courts of admiralty. unlike the usual english common law system, the courts of admiralty hewed closer to continental practice, leaving it open for abuse that contributed to the american revolution. the adoption of the present constitution reintroduced admiralty law to the united states, but with a relatively larger sphere for trials by jury.
the law of the sea is the particular body international law applied to maritime questions and offenses. empires such as rome and china long claimed universal jurisdiction; during the middle ages, italian maritime republics such as venice and genoa recognized the existence of rival states but claimed the right to close the seas to their traffic. portuguese and spanish pursuit of similar rights over new seas and lands during the age of discovery and papal support of their claims was a factor in the wars of religion; in 1609, a jurist hired to defend a lucrative act of piracy by the dutch east india company penned mare liberum, an argument in favor of freedom of the seas that ultimately produced the compromise that territory extended as far as land-based cannonshot could reach, standardized to 3 nautical miles (5,556 m or 18,228 ft), and that everything beyond was international waters. president woodrow wilson argued this principle as part of united states's entrance into world war i and as one of his fourteen points afterwards; nonetheless, president truman's unilateral claim of jurisdiction over the oil reserves of america's continental shelf in 1945 directly led to the end of the regime. the three rounds of the united nations' conferences on the law of the sea eventually reshaped international maritime law but the united states has not ratified the present treaty but instead adopted its policies piecemeal via presidential proclamations.
the present convention on the law of the sea (unclos) was drafted in 1982 and came into force in 1994. it states that the high seas are open to all states, whether coastal or land-locked and provides a non-exhaustive list of freedoms including navigation, overflight, the laying of submarine cables, the building of artificial islands, fishing, and scientific research. it extended territorial waters up to 12 nautical miles (22.2 km or 13.8 mi) from a baseline generally (but not always) equivalent to the low-water line; this area is subject to national laws but free to both innocent and transit passage. (the internal waters landward of the baseline are solely under national control.) a contiguous zone of a further 12 nmi are permitted for hot pursuit of vessels charged with violating customs, taxation, immigration, or pollution laws in the territorial waters. an exclusive economic zone or eez places all exploitation of marine life and minerals within 200 nmi (370 km or 230 mi) of the baseline under national supervision. for legal purposes, the continental shelf is considered to be the actual continental shelf (to a depth of 200 m or 660 ft) contiguous to the baseline or 200 nmi, whichever is greater; the marine life and minerals attached to (or below) the seabed within this area also fall under national supervision.
ships may cross numerous time zones on a voyage, so nautical time, introduced in the 1920s, is used in international waters. each such zone is uniformly 15 degrees of longitude wide, the ship's clock going forward one hour per zone when travelling eastwards. war since the development of coordinated fleets of ships capable of landing an invasion force, naval warfare has been an important aspect in the defense (or conquest) of maritime states. the first naval battle in recorded history saw suppiluliuma ii of the hittites burn a cypriot fleet at sea in 1210 bc. shortly after, the fleets of the sea peoples disrupted the entire eastern mediterranean: over a period of about 50 years, raids and invasions violently destroyed nearly every coastal city between pylos and gaza. as empires grew and their armies became too large to live off the lands through which they passed, disruption of their supply fleets also became a powerful tactic. the 480 bc battle of salamis largely determined the course of the persian wars not because of its inherent damage (however considerable) but because themistocles's deception and superior strategy left the athenians capable of disrupting sea-borne supplies at will and potentially striking at the pontoon bridges across the hellespont, cutting off the persians' line of retreat. during the age of wooden ships, however, great fleets were burdensome to maintain and always liable to destruction by contrary weather, most famously in the case of the two kamikaze typhoons that destroyed the mongol invasions of japan in ad 1274 and 1281.
piracy—both illicit in ancient cilicia and china and state-supported among the cretans, vikings, japanese, english, and berbers—has remained a problem into the present day, given the expense involved in securely protecting every merchant vessel or in policing extensive coastlines. in the ancient world, in addition to salamis, major naval engagements included the battle of actium, which permitted the establishment of augustus's empire. in the modern era, important naval battles include the english victories against the armada in 1588 and at trafalgar in 1805, which broke the threats of invasion by the superior land forces of the spanish and french empires. with steam, mass-produced steel plate, and exploding shells, european gunships permitted the new imperialism of the 19th century, forcing open access to africa, china, korea, and japan for their merchants on favorable terms. although internal politics hampered chinese modernization, american naval power produced a major reform in japan which bore fruit during the 1905 battle of tsushima when the japanese were able to decisively defeat russia. the great navies initially focused their efforts on constructing great dreadnoughts and battleships, but these fought inconclusively in the first world war. by contrast, the much cheaper german u-boats showed that submarines could cripple shipping even in waters nominally controlled by the enemy. convoys, intelligence, and airborne asw won a hard-fought victory in the second world war's battle of the atlantic, but developments in applied physics meant that by the 1960s nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines were being maintained on constant patrol as a second-strike force along with a second set of hunters intended to counter them. meanwhile, the battles of the mediterranean and pacific theaters of the war had shown that air power was capable of overcoming the strongest warships. travel although the use of small private vessels for personal transport undoubtably extends back into prehistory, large ships capable of braving the open ocean were typically dedicated to trade or fishing for most of human history. even military campaigns would often simply hire or commandeer these private fleets to serve as troop transports, as did the traders, pilgrims, and wealthy tourists of antiquity and the middle ages. the voyages of exploration and colonization were often provided for by the crown out of naval funds; where they were not, they were usually chartered or else purchased and then used for shipping supplies after the initial settlement. dedicated and scheduled local passenger services came to be offered in the 16th and 17th centuries, but the 1817 black ball was the first trans-atlantic passenger line. in the age of sail, the duration of such passages depended much on the prevailing winds and the weather. the 18th-century coastal margate hoys began the popularization of leisure travel in britain and ireland that later gathered steam with thomas cook's package tours in the next century. during the 19th century, steam-powered ocean liners connected the railroad networks of the world. by 1900, the atlantic crossing took about five days and the passenger lines competed to win the blue riband, an unofficial accolade accorded to the fastest liner in regular service. for twenty years from 1909, the prize went to the rms mauretania for its average speed of 26.06 knots (48.26 km/h). this era waned as cheaper and faster intercontinental flights became available, most importantly the 1958 new york city–paris route.
the sea still remains a venue for recreational boating and large cruise ships. it is also a route for refugees and economic migrants, some traveling in small unseaworthy craft and others smuggled into shipping vessels. some flee persecution while many are economic migrants attempting to reach countries where they believe their prospects are brighter. leisure use of the sea for leisure developed in the nineteenth century and became a significant industry in the twentieth century. maritime leisure activities are varied and include self-organized trips cruising, yachting, powerboat racing and fishing; commercially organized voyages on cruise ships; and trips on smaller vessels for ecotourism such as whale watching and coastal birdwatching. many humans enjoy venturing into the sea: children paddle and splash in the shallows, while others swim or relax on the beach. this was not always the case, with sea bathing becoming the vogue in europe in the 18th century after dr. william buchan advocated the practice for health reasons. surfing is a sport in which a wave is ridden by a surfer, with or without a surfboard. other water sports include kite surfing, where a power kite propels a manned board across the water; windsurfing, where the power is provided by a fixed, maneuverable sail; and water skiing, where a powerboat is used to pull a skier.
beneath the surface, freediving is necessarily restricted to shallow descents. pearl divers have traditionally greased their skins, put cotton in their ears and clips on their noses, and dived to 40 ft (12 m) with baskets in order to collect pearl oysters. human eyes are not adapted for use underwater, but vision can be improved by wearing a diving mask. other useful equipment includes fins and snorkels. scuba equipment allows underwater breathing, permitting hours of time beneath the surface. the depths that can be reached by divers and the length of time they can stay underwater is limited by the increase of pressure they experience as they descend and the need to prevent decompression sickness as they return to the surface. recreational divers are advised to restrict themselves to depths of under 100 feet (30 m) beyond which the danger of nitrogen narcosis increases. deeper dives can be made with specialized equipment and training. power generation the sea offers a very large supply of energy carried by ocean waves, tides, salinity differences, and ocean temperature differences which can be harnessed to generate electricity. forms of 'green' marine energy include tidal power, marine current power, osmotic power, ocean thermal energy and wave power.
tidal power uses generators to produce electricity from tidal flows, sometimes by using a dam to store and then release seawater. the rance barrage, 1 kilometer (0.62 mi) long, near st malo in brittany opened in 1967; it generates about 0.5 gw, but it has been followed by few similar schemes.
the large and highly variable energy of waves gives them enormous destructive capability, making affordable and reliable wave machines problematic to develop. a small 2 mw commercial wave power plant, osprey, was built in northern scotland in 1995 about 300 meters (1000 ft) offshore. it was soon damaged by waves, then destroyed by a storm. marine current power could provide populated areas close to the sea with a significant part of their energy needs. in principle, it could be harnessed by open-flow turbines; sea bed systems are available, but limited to a depth of about 40 m (130 ft).
offshore wind power is captured by wind turbines placed out at sea; it has the advantage that wind speeds are higher than on land, though wind farms are more costly to construct offshore. the first offshore wind farm was installed in denmark in 1991, and the installed capacity of european offshore wind farms reached 3 gw in 2010.
electricity power stations are often located on the coast or beside an estuary so that the sea can be used as a heat sink. a colder heat sink enables more efficient power generation, which is important for expensive nuclear power plants in particular. extractive industries there are large deposits of petroleum (as oil and natural gas) in rocks beneath the seabed. offshore platforms and drilling rigs extract the oil or gas and store it for transport to land. offshore oil and gas production can be difficult due to the remote, harsh environment. drilling for oil in the sea has environmental impacts. animals may be disorientated by seismic waves used to locate deposits, probably causing the beaching of whales. toxic substances such as mercury, lead, and arsenic may be released. the infrastructure may cause damage and oil may be spilt. the sea holds enormous quantities of valuable dissolved minerals. the most important, salt for table and industrial use has been harvested by solar evaporation from shallow ponds since prehistoric times. bromine, accumulated after being leached from the land, is economically recovered from the dead sea, where it occurs at 55,000 parts per million (ppm). other minerals on or within the seabed can be exploited by dredging. this has advantages over land-based mining in that equipment can be built at specialized shipyards and infrastructure costs are lower. disadvantages include problems caused by waves and tides, the tendency for excavations to silt up, and the washing away of spoil heaps. there is a risk of coastal erosion and environmental damage. sulphide deposits are potential sources of silver, gold, copper, lead, zinc, and trace metals which were only discovered in the 1960s. they form when geothermally superheated water is emitted from deep sea hydrothermal vents known as black smokers: in contact with the cold waters of the deep ocean, the minerals precipitate and settle around the vent. the ores are of high quality but currently very costly to extract. small scale mining of the deep sea floor is being developed off the coast of papua new guinea using robotic techniques, but the obstacles are formidable.
desalination is the technique of removing salts from seawater to leave fresh water suitable for drinking or irrigation. the two main processing methods, vacuum distillation and reverse osmosis, use large quantities of energy. desalination is normally only undertaken where fresh water from other sources is in short supply or energy is plentiful, as in the excess heat generated by power stations. the brine produced as a by-product contains some toxic materials and is returned to the sea.
large quantities of methane clathrate exist on the seabed and in ocean sediment at a temperature of around 2 °c (36 °f) and these are of interest as a potential energy source. some estimates put the amount available at between one and 5 million cubic kilometers (0.24 to 1.2 million cubic miles). also on the seabed are manganese nodules formed of layers of iron, manganese, and other hydroxides around a core. in the pacific these may cover up to 30 percent of the deep ocean floor. the minerals precipitate from seawater and grow very slowly. their commercial extraction for nickel was investigated in the 1970s but abandoned in favour of more convenient sources. in suitable locations, diamonds are gathered from the seafloor using suction hoses to bring gravel ashore. in deeper waters, mobile seafloor crawlers are used and the deposits are pumped to a vessel above. in namibia, more diamonds are now collected from marine sources than by conventional methods on land. pollution many substances enter the sea as a result of human activities. combustion products are transported in the air and deposited through precipitation. agricultural, industrial, and sewage outflows contribute heavy metals, pesticides, pcbs, disinfectants, cleaning products, and other synthetic chemicals. these become concentrated in the surface film and in marine sediment, especially estuarine mud. the result of all this contamination is largely unknown because of the large number of substances involved and the lack of information on their biological effects. the heavy metals of greatest concern are copper, lead, mercury, cadmium, and zinc which may be accumulated by marine invertebrates. they are then passed up the food chain.
run-off of fertilizers from agricultural land is a major source of pollution in some areas and the discharge of raw sewage has a similar effect. the extra nutrients provided by these sources can cause excessive plant growth. nitrogen is often the limiting factor in marine systems and the addition of nitrogen sparks algal blooms and red tides, which then may lower the oxygen level of the water to the point where it kills marine animals. such events have created dead zones in the baltic sea and the gulf of mexico. some algal blooms are caused by cyanobacteria that make shellfish that filter feed on them toxic, harming animals like sea otters. nuclear facilities too can pollute. the irish sea was contaminated by radioactive caesium-137 from the former sellafield nuclear fuel processing plant and nuclear accidents sometimes cause radioactive material to seep into the sea, as at the fukushima in 2011.
the dumping of waste (including oil, noxious liquids, sewage, and garbage) at sea is governed by international law. the london convention (1972) is a united nations agreement to control ocean dumping which had been ratified by 89 countries by 8 june 2012. marpol 73/78 is a convention to minimize pollution of the seas by ships. by may 2013, 152 maritime nations had ratified marpol.
much floating plastic trash does not biodegrade, instead disintegrating over time and eventually breaking down to the molecular level. rigid plastics may float for years. in the center of the pacific gyre, there is a permanent floating accumulation of mostly plastic waste and there is a similar garbage patch in the atlantic. foraging sea birds such as the albatross and petrel may mistake debris for food and accumulate indigestible plastic in their digestive systems. turtles and whales have been found with plastic bags and fishing line in their stomachs. microplastics may sink, threatening filter feeders on the seabed.
most oil pollution in the sea comes from cities and industry. oil is dangerous for marine animals. it can clog the feathers of sea birds, reducing their insulating effect and the birds' buoyancy, or be ingested when they preen themselves in an attempt to remove the contaminant. marine mammals are less seriously affected but may be chilled through the removal of their insulation, blinded, dehydrated, or poisoned. benthic invertebrates are swamped when the oil sinks, fish are poisoned, and the food chain is disrupted. in the short term, oil spills result in wildlife populations being decreased and unbalanced, leisure activities being affected, and the livelihoods of people dependent on the sea being devastated. the marine environment has self-cleansing properties and naturally occurring bacteria will act over time to remove oil from the sea. in the gulf of mexico, where oil-eating bacteria are already present, they take only a few days to consume spilt oil. indigenous sea peoples several nomadic indigenous groups in maritime southeast asia live in boats and derive nearly all they need from the sea. the moken people live on the coasts of thailand and burma and islands in the andaman sea. the bajau people are originally from the sulu archipelago, mindanao, and northern borneo. some sea gypsies are accomplished free-divers, able to descend to depths of 30 m (98 ft), though many are adopting a more settled, land-based way of life.
the indigenous peoples of the arctic such as the chukchi, inuit, inuvialuit, and yupik hunt marine mammals including seals and whales and the torres strait islanders claim ownership of the great barrier reef. they live a traditional life on the islands involving hunting, fishing, gardening, and trading with neighboring peoples in papua new guinea and australia. in culture the sea appears in human culture in contradictory ways, as both powerful but serene and as beautiful but dangerous. it has its place in mythology and religion, literature, art, poetry, film, theater, and music. the ancients personified it, believing it to be under the control of a being who needed to be appeased. it has been populated by fantastic creatures: the leviathan of the bible, scylla in greek mythology, isonade in japanese mythology, and the kraken of late norse mythology. the sea is especially common in christian imagery, where several of jesus's disciples were said to have been fishermen on the sea of galilee. the sea, its life, and its ships have been depicted in art ranging from the simple drawings on the walls of caves outside les eyzies, france, to the early christian ichthys to the dutch hendrik vroom to hokusai's ukiyo-e to seascapes by winslow homer. during the golden age of the netherlands, artists such as jan porcellis, hendrick dubbels, willem van de velde the elder and his son, and ludolf bakhuizen celebrated the sea and the dutch navy at the peak of its military prowess.
music too has been inspired by the ocean. sea shanties were chanted by mariners to help coordinate arduous tasks and impressions in music have been created of calm waters, crashing waves, and storms at sea. classical sea-related music includes richard wagner's the flying dutchman, claude debussy's la mer (1903–05), charles villiers stanford's songs of the sea (1904) and songs of the fleet (1910), edward elgar's sea pictures (1899), and ralph vaughan williams's a sea symphony (1903–1909). as a symbol, the sea has for centuries played a role in literature and poetry. sometimes, it is there just as a gentle background but often it introduces such themes as storm, shipwreck, battle, hardship, disaster, the dashing of hopes, or death. in his epic poem the odyssey, written in the 8th century bc, homer describes the ten-year voyage of the greek hero odysseus who struggles to return home across the sea's many hazards after the war described in the iliad. the sea is a recurring theme in the haiku poems of the japanese poet matsuo bashō (1644–1694). in modern literature, sea-inspired novels have been written by the sailors herman melville, joseph conrad, and herman wouk. the psychiatrist carl jung argued that, in dream interpretation, the sea symbolizes the personal and the collective unconscious. although the origin of life on earth is still a matter of debate, naturalist rachel carson wrote in the sea around us that it is a curious situation that the sea, from which life first arose, should now be threatened by the activities of one form of that life. but the sea, though changed in a sinister way, will continue to exist: the threat is rather to life itself. see also seas – wikipedia book notes references external links national oceanic and atmospheric administration—noaa website

earth is the third planet from the sun and the only object in the universe known to harbor life. according to radiometric dating and other sources of evidence, earth formed over 4 billion years ago. earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, especially the sun and the moon, earth's only natural satellite. earth revolves around the sun in 365.26 days, a period known as an earth year. during this time, earth rotates about its axis about 366.26 times.
earth's axis of rotation is tilted, producing seasonal variations on the planet's surface. the gravitational interaction between the earth and moon causes ocean tides, stabilizes the earth's orientation on its axis, and gradually slows its rotation. earth is the densest planet in the solar system and the largest of the four terrestrial planets.
earth's lithosphere is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over periods of many millions of years. about 71% of earth's surface is covered with water, mostly by its oceans. the remaining 29% is land consisting of continents and islands that together have many lakes, rivers and other sources of water that contribute to the hydrosphere. the majority of earth's polar regions are covered in ice, including the antarctic ice sheet and the sea ice of the arctic ice pack. earth's interior remains active with a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates the earth's magnetic field, and a convecting mantle that drives plate tectonics.
within the first billion years of earth's history, life appeared in the oceans and began to affect the earth's atmosphere and surface, leading to the proliferation of aerobic and anaerobic organisms. some geological evidence indicates that life may have arisen as much as 4.1 billion years ago. since then, the combination of earth's distance from the sun, physical properties, and geological history have allowed life to evolve and thrive. in the history of the earth, biodiversity has gone through long periods of expansion, occasionally punctuated by mass extinction events. over 99% of all species that ever lived on earth are extinct. estimates of the number of species on earth today vary widely; most species have not been described. over 7.4 billion humans live on earth and depend on its biosphere and natural resources for their survival. humans have developed diverse societies and cultures; politically, the world has about 200 sovereign states. name and etymology the modern english word earth developed from a wide variety of middle english forms, which derived from an old english noun most often spelled eorðe. it has cognates in every germanic language, and their proto-germanic root has been reconstructed as *erþō. in its earliest appearances, eorðe was already being used to translate the many senses of latin terra and greek γῆ (gē): the ground, its soil, dry land, the human world, the surface of the world (including the sea), and the globe itself. as with terra and gaia, earth was a personified goddess in germanic paganism: the angles were listed by tacitus as among the devotees of nerthus, and later norse mythology included jörð, a giantess often given as the mother of thor.
originally, earth was written in lowercase, and from early middle english, its definite sense as the globe was expressed as the earth. by early modern english, many nouns were capitalized, and the earth became (and often remained) the earth, particularly when referenced along with other heavenly bodies. more recently, the name is sometimes simply given as earth, by analogy with the names of the other planets. house styles now vary: oxford spelling recognizes the lowercase form as the most common, with the capitalized form an acceptable variant. another convention capitalizes earth when appearing as a name (e.g. earth's atmosphere) but writes it in lowercase when preceded by the (e.g. the atmosphere of the earth). it almost always appears in lowercase in colloquial expressions such as what on earth are you doing? chronology formation the oldest material found in the solar system is dated to 4.5672±0.0006 billion years ago (bya). by 4.54±0.04 bya the primordial earth had formed. the formation and evolution of solar system bodies occurred along with the sun. in theory, a solar nebula partitions a volume out of a molecular cloud by gravitational collapse, which begins to spin and flatten into a circumstellar disk, and then the planets grow out of that disk along with the sun. a nebula contains gas, ice grains, and dust (including primordial nuclides). according to nebular theory, planetesimals formed by accretion, with the primordial earth taking 10–20 million years (mys) to form.
a subject of on-going research is the formation of the moon, some 4.53 bya. a working hypothesis is that it was formed by accretion from material loosed from earth after a mars-sized object, named theia, impacted earth. in this scenario, the mass of theia was approximately 10% of that of earth, it impacted earth with a glancing blow, and some of its mass merged with earth. between approximately 4.1 and 3.8 bya, numerous asteroid impacts during the late heavy bombardment caused significant changes to the greater surface environment of the moon, and by inference, to that of earth. geological history earth's atmosphere and oceans were formed by volcanic activity and outgassing that included water vapor. the origin of the world's oceans was condensation augmented by water and ice delivered by asteroids, protoplanets, and comets. in this model, atmospheric greenhouse gases kept the oceans from freezing when the newly forming sun had only 70% of its current luminosity. by 3.5 bya, earth's magnetic field was established, which helped prevent the atmosphere from being stripped away by the solar wind.
a crust formed when the molten outer layer of earth cooled to form a solid. the two models that explain land mass propose either a steady growth to the present-day forms or, more likely, a rapid growth early in earth history followed by a long-term steady continental area. continents formed by plate tectonics, a process ultimately driven by the continuous loss of heat from earth's interior. on time scales lasting hundreds of millions of years, the supercontinents have assembled and broken apart. roughly 750 million years ago (mya), one of the earliest known supercontinents, rodinia, began to break apart. the continents later recombined to form pannotia, 600–540 mya, then finally pangaea, which also broke apart 180 mya.
the present pattern of ice ages began about 40 mya and then intensified during the pleistocene about 3 mya. high-latitude regions have since undergone repeated cycles of glaciation and thaw, repeating about every 40,000–100000 years. the last continental glaciation ended 10,000 years ago. origin of life and evolution chemical reactions led to the first self-replicating molecules about four billion years ago. a half billion years later, the last common ancestor of all life arose. the evolution of photosynthesis allowed the sun's energy to be harvested directly by life forms. the resultant molecular oxygen (o2) accumulated in the atmosphere and due to interaction with ultraviolet solar radiation, formed a protective ozone layer (o3) in the upper atmosphere. the incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted in the development of complex cells called eukaryotes. true multicellular organisms formed as cells within colonies became increasingly specialized. aided by the absorption of harmful ultraviolet radiation by the ozone layer, life colonized earth's surface. among the earliest fossil evidence for life is microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone in western australia, biogenic graphite found in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks in western greenland, remains of biotic material found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in western australia.
during the neoproterozoic, 750 to 580 mya, much of earth might have been covered in ice. this hypothesis has been termed snowball earth, and it is of particular interest because it preceded the cambrian explosion, when multicellular life forms significantly increased in complexity. following the cambrian explosion, 535 mya, there have been five major mass extinctions. the most recent such event was 66 mya, when an asteroid impact triggered the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs and other large reptiles, but spared some small animals such as mammals, which then resembled shrews. over the past 66 mys, mammalian life has diversified, and several million years ago an african ape-like animal such as orrorin tugenensis gained the ability to stand upright. this facilitated tool use and encouraged communication that provided the nutrition and stimulation needed for a larger brain, which allowed the evolution of humans. the development of agriculture, and then civilization, led to humans having an influence on earth and the nature and quantity of other life forms that continues today. future earth's expected long-term future is closely tied to that of the sun. over the next 1.1 bys, solar luminosity will increase by 10%, and over the next 3.5 bys by 40%. the earth's increasing surface temperature will accelerate the inorganic co2 cycle, reducing its concentration to levels lethally low for plants (10 ppm for c4 photosynthesis) in approximately 500–900 mys. the lack of vegetation will result in the loss of oxygen in the atmosphere, and animal life will become extinct. after another billion years all surface water will have disappeared and the mean global temperature will reach 70 °c (158 °f). from that point, the earth is expected to be habitable for another 500 ma, possibly up to 2.3 ga if nitrogen is removed from the atmosphere. even if the sun were eternal and stable, 27% of the water in the modern oceans will descend to the mantle in one billion years, due to reduced steam venting from mid-ocean ridges.
the sun will evolve to become a red giant in about 5 bys. models predict that the sun will expand to roughly 1 au (150 million km; 93 million mi), which is about 250 times its present radius. earth's fate is less clear. as a red giant, the sun will lose roughly 30% of its mass, so, without tidal effects, earth will move to an orbit 1.7 au (250 million km; 160 million mi) from the sun when the star reaches its maximum radius. most, if not all, remaining life will be destroyed by the sun's increased luminosity (peaking at about 5,000 times its present level). a 2008 simulation indicates that earth's orbit will eventually decay due to tidal effects and drag, causing it to enter the sun's atmosphere and be vaporized. physical characteristics shape the shape of earth is approximately oblate spheroidal. due to rotation, the earth is flattened along the geographic axis and bulging around the equator. the diameter of the earth at the equator is 43 kilometres (27 mi) larger than the pole-to-pole diameter. thus the point on the surface farthest from earth's center of mass is the summit of the equatorial chimborazo volcano in ecuador. the average diameter of the reference spheroid is 12,742 kilometres (7,918 mi). local topography deviates from this idealized spheroid, although on a global scale these deviations are small compared to earth's radius: the maximum deviation of only 0.17% is at the mariana trench (10,911 metres (35,797 ft) below local sea level), whereas mount everest (8,848 metres (29,029 ft) above local sea level) represents a deviation of 0.14%.
in geodesy, the exact shape that earth's oceans would adopt in the absence of land and perturbations such as tides and winds is called the geoid. more precisely, the geoid is the surface of gravitational equipotential at mean sea level. chemical composition earth's mass is approximately 5.97×1024 kg (5,970 yg). it is composed mostly of iron (32.1%), oxygen (30.1%), silicon (15.1%), magnesium (13.9%), sulfur (2.9%), nickel (1.8%), calcium (1.5%), and aluminium (1.4%), with the remaining 1.2% consisting of trace amounts of other elements. due to mass segregation, the core region is estimated to be primarily composed of iron (88.8%), with smaller amounts of nickel (5.8%), sulfur (4.5%), and less than 1% trace elements.
the most common rock constituents of the crust are nearly all oxides: chlorine, sulfur, and fluorine are the important exceptions to this and their total amount in any rock is usually much less than 1%. over 99% of the crust is composed of 11 oxides, principally silica, alumina, iron oxides, lime, magnesia, potash, and soda. internal structure earth's interior, like that of the other terrestrial planets, is divided into layers by their chemical or physical (rheological) properties. the outer layer is a chemically distinct silicate solid crust, which is underlain by a highly viscous solid mantle. the crust is separated from the mantle by the mohorovičić discontinuity. the thickness of the crust varies from about 6 km (kilometers) under the oceans to 30–50 km for the continents. the crust and the cold, rigid, top of the upper mantle are collectively known as the lithosphere, and it is of the lithosphere that the tectonic plates are composed. beneath the lithosphere is the asthenosphere, a relatively low-viscosity layer on which the lithosphere rides. important changes in crystal structure within the mantle occur at 410 and 660 km below the surface, spanning a transition zone that separates the upper and lower mantle. beneath the mantle, an extremely low viscosity liquid outer core lies above a solid inner core. the earth's inner core might rotate at a slightly higher angular velocity than the remainder of the planet, advancing by 0.1–0.5° per year. the radius of the inner core is about one fifth of that of earth. heat earth's internal heat comes from a combination of residual heat from planetary accretion (about 20%) and heat produced through radioactive decay (80%). the major heat-producing isotopes within earth are potassium-40, uranium-238, and thorium-232. at the center, the temperature may be up to 6,000 °c (10,830 °f), and the pressure could reach 360 gpa. because much of the heat is provided by radioactive decay, scientists postulate that early in earth's history, before isotopes with short half-lives were depleted, earth's heat production was much higher. at approximately 3 ga, twice the present-day heat would have been produced, increasing the rates of mantle convection and plate tectonics, and allowing the production of uncommon igneous rocks such as komatiites that are rarely formed today.
the mean heat loss from earth is 87 mw m−2, for a global heat loss of 4.42 × 1013 w. a portion of the core's thermal energy is transported toward the crust by mantle plumes, a form of convection consisting of upwellings of higher-temperature rock. these plumes can produce hotspots and flood basalts. more of the heat in earth is lost through plate tectonics, by mantle upwelling associated with mid-ocean ridges. the final major mode of heat loss is through conduction through the lithosphere, the majority of which occurs under the oceans because the crust there is much thinner than that of the continents. tectonic plates the mechanically rigid outer layer of earth, the lithosphere, is divided into pieces called tectonic plates. these plates are rigid segments that move in relation to one another at one of three types of plate boundaries: convergent boundaries, at which two plates come together, divergent boundaries, at which two plates are pulled apart, and transform boundaries, in which two plates slide past one another laterally. earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain-building, and oceanic trench formation can occur along these plate boundaries. the tectonic plates ride on top of the asthenosphere, the solid but less-viscous part of the upper mantle that can flow and move along with the plates.
as the tectonic plates migrate, oceanic crust is subducted under the leading edges of the plates at convergent boundaries. at the same time, the upwelling of mantle material at divergent boundaries creates mid-ocean ridges. the combination of these processes recycles the oceanic crust back into the mantle. due to this recycling, most of the ocean floor is less than 100 ma old in age. the oldest oceanic crust is located in the western pacific and has an estimated age of 200 ma. by comparison, the oldest dated continental crust is 4030 ma.
the seven major plates are the pacific, north american, eurasian, african, antarctic, indo-australian, and south american. other notable plates include the arabian plate, the caribbean plate, the nazca plate off the west coast of south america and the scotia plate in the southern atlantic ocean. the australian plate fused with the indian plate between 50 and 55 mya. the fastest-moving plates are the oceanic plates, with the cocos plate advancing at a rate of 75 mm/year and the pacific plate moving 52–69 mm/year. at the other extreme, the slowest-moving plate is the eurasian plate, progressing at a typical rate of 21 mm/year. surface the total surface area of the earth is about 510 million km2 (197 million sq mi). of this, 70.8%, or 361.13 million km2 (139.43 million sq mi), is below sea level and covered by ocean water. below the ocean's surface are much of the continental shelf, mountains, volcanoes, oceanic trenches, submarine canyons, oceanic plateaus, abyssal plains, and a globe-spanning mid-ocean ridge system. the remaining 29.2% (148.94 million km2, or 57.51 million sq mi) not covered by water has terrain that varies greatly from place to place and consists of mountains, deserts, plains, plateaus, and other landforms. tectonics and erosion, volcanic eruptions, flooding, weathering, glaciation, the growth of coral reefs, and meteorite impacts are among the processes that constantly reshape the earth's surface over geological time.
the continental crust consists of lower density material such as the igneous rocks granite and andesite. less common is basalt, a denser volcanic rock that is the primary constituent of the ocean floors. sedimentary rock is formed from the accumulation of sediment that becomes buried and compacted together. nearly 75% of the continental surfaces are covered by sedimentary rocks, although they form about 5% of the crust. the third form of rock material found on earth is metamorphic rock, which is created from the transformation of pre-existing rock types through high pressures, high temperatures, or both. the most abundant silicate minerals on earth's surface include quartz, feldspars, amphibole, mica, pyroxene and olivine. common carbonate minerals include calcite (found in limestone) and dolomite.
the elevation of the land surface varies from the low point of −418 m at the dead sea, to a maximum altitude of 8,848 m at the top of mount everest. the mean height of land above sea level is about 797 metres (2,615 ft).
the pedosphere is the outermost layer of earth's continental surface and is composed of soil and subject to soil formation processes. the total arable land is 10.9% of the land surface, with 1.3% being permanent cropland. close to 40% of earth's land surface is used for cropland and pasture, or an estimated 1.3×107 km2 of cropland and 3.4×107 km2 of pastureland. hydrosphere the abundance of water on earth's surface is a unique feature that distinguishes the blue planet from other planets in the solar system. earth's hydrosphere consists chiefly of the oceans, but technically includes all water surfaces in the world, including inland seas, lakes, rivers, and underground waters down to a depth of 2,000 m. the deepest underwater location is challenger deep of the mariana trench in the pacific ocean with a depth of 10,911.4 m.
the mass of the oceans is approximately 1.35×1018 metric tons or about 1/4400 of earth's total mass. the oceans cover an area of 3.618×108 km2 with a mean depth of 3682 m, resulting in an estimated volume of 1.332×109 km3. if all of earth's crustal surface were at the same elevation as a smooth sphere, the depth of the resulting world ocean would be 2.7 to 2.8 km.
about 97.5% of the water is saline; the remaining 2.5% is fresh water. most fresh water, about 68.7%, is present as ice in ice caps and glaciers.
the average salinity of earth's oceans is about 35 grams of salt per kilogram of sea water (3.5% salt). most of this salt was released from volcanic activity or extracted from cool igneous rocks. the oceans are also a reservoir of dissolved atmospheric gases, which are essential for the survival of many aquatic life forms. sea water has an important influence on the world's climate, with the oceans acting as a large heat reservoir. shifts in the oceanic temperature distribution can cause significant weather shifts, such as the el niño-southern oscillation. atmosphere the atmospheric pressure on earth's surface averages 101.325 kpa, with a scale height of about 8.5 km. it has a composition of 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen, with trace amounts of water vapor, carbon dioxide, and other gaseous molecules. the height of the troposphere varies with latitude, ranging between 8 km at the poles to 17 km at the equator, with some variation resulting from weather and seasonal factors.
earth's biosphere has significantly altered its atmosphere. oxygenic photosynthesis evolved 2.7 gya, forming the primarily nitrogen–oxygen atmosphere of today. this change enabled the proliferation of aerobic organisms and, indirectly, the formation of the ozone layer due to the subsequent conversion of atmospheric o2 into o3. the ozone layer blocks ultraviolet solar radiation, permitting life on land. other atmospheric functions important to life include transporting water vapor, providing useful gases, causing small meteors to burn up before they strike the surface, and moderating temperature. this last phenomenon is known as the greenhouse effect: trace molecules within the atmosphere serve to capture thermal energy emitted from the ground, thereby raising the average temperature. water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone are the primary greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. without this heat-retention effect, the average surface temperature would be −18 °c, in contrast to the current +15 °c, and life on earth probably would not exist in its current form. in may 2017, glints of light, seen as twinkling from an orbiting satellite a million miles away, were found to be reflected light from ice crystals in the atmosphere. weather and climate earth's atmosphere has no definite boundary, slowly becoming thinner and fading into outer space. three-quarters of the atmosphere's mass is contained within the first 11 km (6.8 mi) of the surface. this lowest layer is called the troposphere. energy from the sun heats this layer, and the surface below, causing expansion of the air. this lower-density air then rises and is replaced by cooler, higher-density air. the result is atmospheric circulation that drives the weather and climate through redistribution of thermal energy.
the primary atmospheric circulation bands consist of the trade winds in the equatorial region below 30° latitude and the westerlies in the mid-latitudes between 30° and 60°. ocean currents are also important factors in determining climate, particularly the thermohaline circulation that distributes thermal energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions.
water vapor generated through surface evaporation is transported by circulatory patterns in the atmosphere. when atmospheric conditions permit an uplift of warm, humid air, this water condenses and falls to the surface as precipitation. most of the water is then transported to lower elevations by river systems and usually returned to the oceans or deposited into lakes. this water cycle is a vital mechanism for supporting life on land and is a primary factor in the erosion of surface features over geological periods. precipitation patterns vary widely, ranging from several meters of water per year to less than a millimeter. atmospheric circulation, topographic features, and temperature differences determine the average precipitation that falls in each region.
the amount of solar energy reaching earth's surface decreases with increasing latitude. at higher latitudes, the sunlight reaches the surface at lower angles, and it must pass through thicker columns of the atmosphere. as a result, the mean annual air temperature at sea level decreases by about 0.4 °c (0.7 °f) per degree of latitude from the equator. earth's surface can be subdivided into specific latitudinal belts of approximately homogeneous climate. ranging from the equator to the polar regions, these are the tropical (or equatorial), subtropical, temperate and polar climates.
this latitudinal rule has several anomalies:
proximity to oceans moderates the climate. for example, the scandinavian peninsula has more moderate climate than similarly northern latitudes of northern canada.
the wind enables this moderating effect. the windward side of a land mass experiences more moderation than the leeward side. in the northern hemisphere, the prevailing wind is west-to-east, and western coasts tend to be milder than eastern coasts. this is seen in eastern north america and western europe, where rough continental climates appear on the east coast on parallels with mild climates on the other side of the ocean. in the southern hemisphere, the prevailing wind is east-to-west, and the eastern coasts are milder.
the distance from the earth to the sun varies. the earth is closest to the sun (at perihelion) in january, which is summer in the southern hemisphere. it is furthest away (at aphelion) in july, which is summer in the northern hemisphere, and only 93.55% of the solar radiation from the sun falls on a given square area of land than at perihelion. despite this, there are larger land masses in the northern hemisphere, which are easier to heat than the seas. consequently, summers are 2.3 °c (4 °f) warmer in the northern hemisphere than in the southern hemisphere under similar conditions.
the climate is colder at high altitudes than at sea level because of the decreased air density.
the commonly used köppen climate classification system has five broad groups (humid tropics, arid, humid middle latitudes, continental and cold polar), which are further divided into more specific subtypes. the köppen system rates regions of terrain based on observed temperature and precipitation.
the highest air temperature ever measured on earth was 56.7 °c (134.1 °f) in furnace creek, california, in death valley, in 1913. the lowest air temperature ever directly measured on earth was −89.2 °c (−128.6 °f) at vostok station in 1983, but satellites have used remote sensing to measure temperatures as low as −94.7 °c (−138.5 °f) in east antarctica. these temperature records are only measurements made with modern instruments from the 20th century onwards and likely do not reflect the full range of temperature on earth. upper atmosphere above the troposphere, the atmosphere is usually divided into the stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere. each layer has a different lapse rate, defining the rate of change in temperature with height. beyond these, the exosphere thins out into the magnetosphere, where the geomagnetic fields interact with the solar wind. within the stratosphere is the ozone layer, a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on earth. the kármán line, defined as 100 km above earth's surface, is a working definition for the boundary between the atmosphere and outer space.
thermal energy causes some of the molecules at the outer edge of the atmosphere to increase their velocity to the point where they can escape from earth's gravity. this causes a slow but steady loss of the atmosphere into space. because unfixed hydrogen has a low molecular mass, it can achieve escape velocity more readily, and it leaks into outer space at a greater rate than other gases. the leakage of hydrogen into space contributes to the shifting of earth's atmosphere and surface from an initially reducing state to its current oxidizing one. photosynthesis provided a source of free oxygen, but the loss of reducing agents such as hydrogen is thought to have been a necessary precondition for the widespread accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere. hence the ability of hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere may have influenced the nature of life that developed on earth. in the current, oxygen-rich atmosphere most hydrogen is converted into water before it has an opportunity to escape. instead, most of the hydrogen loss comes from the destruction of methane in the upper atmosphere. gravitational field the gravity of earth is the acceleration that is imparted to objects due to the distribution of mass within the earth. near the earth's surface, gravitational acceleration is approximately 9.8 m/s2 (32 ft/s2). local differences in topography, geology, and deeper tectonic structure cause local and broad, regional differences in the earth's gravitational field, known as gravitational anomalies. magnetic field the main part of earth's magnetic field is generated in the core, the site of a dynamo process that converts the kinetic energy of thermally and compositionally driven convection into electrical and magnetic field energy. the field extends outwards from the core, through the mantle, and up to earth's surface, where it is, approximately, a dipole. the poles of the dipole are located close to earth's geographic poles. at the equator of the magnetic field, the magnetic-field strength at the surface is 3.05 × 10−5 t, with global magnetic dipole moment of 7.91 × 1015 t m3. the convection movements in the core are chaotic; the magnetic poles drift and periodically change alignment. this causes secular variation of the main field and field reversals at irregular intervals averaging a few times every million years. the most recent reversal occurred approximately 700,000 years ago. magnetosphere the extent of earth's magnetic field in space defines the magnetosphere. ions and electrons of the solar wind are deflected by the magnetosphere; solar wind pressure compresses the dayside of the magnetosphere, to about 10 earth radii, and extends the nightside magnetosphere into a long tail. because the velocity of the solar wind is greater than the speed at which wave propagate through the solar wind, a supersonic bowshock precedes the dayside magnetosphere within the solar wind. charged particles are contained within the magnetosphere; the plasmasphere is defined by low-energy particles that essentially follow magnetic field lines as earth rotates; the ring current is defined by medium-energy particles that drift relative to the geomagnetic field, but with paths that are still dominated by the magnetic field, and the van allen radiation belt are formed by high-energy particles whose motion is essentially random, but otherwise contained by the magnetosphere.
during magnetic storms and substorms, charged particles can be deflected from the outer magnetosphere and especially the magnetotail, directed along field lines into earth's ionosphere, where atmospheric atoms can be excited and ionized, causing the aurora. orbit and rotation rotation earth's rotation period relative to the sun—its mean solar day—is 86,400 seconds of mean solar time (86,400.0025 si seconds). because earth's solar day is now slightly longer than it was during the 19th century due to tidal deceleration, each day varies between 0 and 2 si ms longer.
earth's rotation period relative to the fixed stars, called its stellar day by the international earth rotation and reference systems service (iers), is 86,164.0989 seconds of mean solar time (ut1), or 23h 56m 4.0989s. earth's rotation period relative to the precessing or moving mean vernal equinox, misnamed its sidereal day, is 86,164.0905 seconds of mean solar time (ut1) (23h 56m 4.0905s). thus the sidereal day is shorter than the stellar day by about 8.4 ms. the length of the mean solar day in si seconds is available from the iers for the periods 1623–2005 and 1962–2005.
apart from meteors within the atmosphere and low-orbiting satellites, the main apparent motion of celestial bodies in earth's sky is to the west at a rate of 15°/h 15'/min. for bodies near the celestial equator, this is equivalent to an apparent diameter of the sun or the moon every two minutes; from earth's surface, the apparent sizes of the sun and the moon are approximately the same. orbit earth orbits the sun at an average distance of about 150 million km (93 million mi) every 365.2564 mean solar days, or one sidereal year. this gives an apparent movement of the sun eastward with respect to the stars at a rate of about 1°/day, which is one apparent sun or moon diameter every 12 hours. due to this motion, on average it takes 24 hours—a solar day—for earth to complete a full rotation about its axis so that the sun returns to the meridian. the orbital speed of earth averages about 29.78 km/s (107,200 km/h; 66,600 mph), which is fast enough to travel a distance equal to earth's diameter, about 12,742 km (7,918 mi), in seven minutes, and the distance to the moon, 384,000 km (239,000 mi), in about 3.5 hours.
the moon and earth orbit a common barycenter every 27.32 days relative to the background stars. when combined with the earth–moon system's common orbit around the sun, the period of the synodic month, from new moon to new moon, is 29.53 days. viewed from the celestial north pole, the motion of earth, the moon, and their axial rotations are all counterclockwise. viewed from a vantage point above the north poles of both the sun and earth, earth orbits in a counterclockwise direction about the sun. the orbital and axial planes are not precisely aligned: earth's axis is tilted some 23.44 degrees from the perpendicular to the earth–sun plane (the ecliptic), and the earth–moon plane is tilted up to ±5.1 degrees against the earth–sun plane. without this tilt, there would be an eclipse every two weeks, alternating between lunar eclipses and solar eclipses.
the hill sphere, or the sphere of gravitational influence, of the earth is about 1.5 million kilometres (930,000 mi) in radius. this is the maximum distance at which the earth's gravitational influence is stronger than the more distant sun and planets. objects must orbit the earth within this radius, or they can become unbound by the gravitational perturbation of the sun.
earth, along with the solar system, is situated in the milky way and orbits about 28,000 light-years from its center. it is about 20 light-years above the galactic plane in the orion arm. axial tilt and seasons the axial tilt of the earth is approximately 23.439281° with the axis of its orbit plane, always pointing towards the celestial poles. due to earth's axial tilt, the amount of sunlight reaching any given point on the surface varies over the course of the year. this causes the seasonal change in climate, with summer in the northern hemisphere occurring when the tropic of cancer is facing the sun, and winter taking place when the tropic of capricorn in the southern hemisphere faces the sun. during the summer, the day lasts longer, and the sun climbs higher in the sky. in winter, the climate becomes cooler and the days shorter. in northern temperate latitudes, the sun rises north of true east during the summer solstice, and sets north of true west, reversing in the winter. the sun rises south of true east in the summer for the southern temperate zone and sets south of true west.
above the arctic circle, an extreme case is reached where there is no daylight at all for part of the year, up to six months at the north pole itself, a polar night. in the southern hemisphere, the situation is exactly reversed, with the south pole oriented opposite the direction of the north pole. six months later, this pole will experience a midnight sun, a day of 24 hours, again reversing with the south pole.
by astronomical convention, the four seasons can be determined by the solstices—the points in the orbit of maximum axial tilt toward or away from the sun—and the equinoxes, when the direction of the tilt and the direction to the sun are perpendicular. in the northern hemisphere, winter solstice currently occurs around 21 december; summer solstice is near 21 june, spring equinox is around 20 march and autumnal equinox is about 22 or 23 september. in the southern hemisphere, the situation is reversed, with the summer and winter solstices exchanged and the spring and autumnal equinox dates swapped.
the angle of earth's axial tilt is relatively stable over long periods of time. its axial tilt does undergo nutation; a slight, irregular motion with a main period of 18.6 years. the orientation (rather than the angle) of earth's axis also changes over time, precessing around in a complete circle over each 25,800 year cycle; this precession is the reason for the difference between a sidereal year and a tropical year. both of these motions are caused by the varying attraction of the sun and the moon on earth's equatorial bulge. the poles also migrate a few meters across earth's surface. this polar motion has multiple, cyclical components, which collectively are termed quasiperiodic motion. in addition to an annual component to this motion, there is a 14-month cycle called the chandler wobble. earth's rotational velocity also varies in a phenomenon known as length-of-day variation.
in modern times, earth's perihelion occurs around 3 january, and its aphelion around 4 july. these dates change over time due to precession and other orbital factors, which follow cyclical patterns known as milankovitch cycles. the changing earth–sun distance causes an increase of about 6.9% in solar energy reaching earth at perihelion relative to aphelion. because the southern hemisphere is tilted toward the sun at about the same time that earth reaches the closest approach to the sun, the southern hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the sun than does the northern over the course of a year. this effect is much less significant than the total energy change due to the axial tilt, and most of the excess energy is absorbed by the higher proportion of water in the southern hemisphere. habitability a planet that can sustain life is termed habitable, even if life did not originate there. earth provides liquid water—an environment where complex organic molecules can assemble and interact, and sufficient energy to sustain metabolism. the distance of earth from the sun, as well as its orbital eccentricity, rate of rotation, axial tilt, geological history, sustaining atmosphere, and magnetic field all contribute to the current climatic conditions at the surface. biosphere a planet's life forms inhabit ecosystems, whose total is sometimes said to form a biosphere. earth's biosphere is thought to have begun evolving about 3.5 gya. the biosphere is divided into a number of biomes, inhabited by broadly similar plants and animals. on land, biomes are separated primarily by differences in latitude, height above sea level and humidity. terrestrial biomes lying within the arctic or antarctic circles, at high altitudes or in extremely arid areas are relatively barren of plant and animal life; species diversity reaches a peak in humid lowlands at equatorial latitudes.
in july 2016, scientists reported identifying a set of 355 genes from the last universal common ancestor (luca) of all organisms living on earth. natural resources and land use earth has resources that have been exploited by humans. those termed non-renewable resources, such as fossil fuels, only renew over geological timescales.
large deposits of fossil fuels are obtained from earth's crust, consisting of coal, petroleum, and natural gas. these deposits are used by humans both for energy production and as feedstock for chemical production. mineral ore bodies have also been formed within the crust through a process of ore genesis, resulting from actions of magmatism, erosion, and plate tectonics. these bodies form concentrated sources for many metals and other useful elements.
earth's biosphere produces many useful biological products for humans, including food, wood, pharmaceuticals, oxygen, and the recycling of many organic wastes. the land-based ecosystem depends upon topsoil and fresh water, and the oceanic ecosystem depends upon dissolved nutrients washed down from the land. in 1980, 5,053 mha (50.53 million km2) of earth's land surface consisted of forest and woodlands, 6,788 mha (67.88 million km2) was grasslands and pasture, and 1,501 mha (15.01 million km2) was cultivated as croplands. the estimated amount of irrigated land in 1993 was 2,481,250 square kilometres (958,020 sq mi). humans also live on the land by using building materials to construct shelters. natural and environmental hazards large areas of earth's surface are subject to extreme weather such as tropical cyclones, hurricanes, or typhoons that dominate life in those areas. from 1980 to 2000, these events caused an average of 11,800 human deaths per year. many places are subject to earthquakes, landslides, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, tornadoes, sinkholes, blizzards, floods, droughts, wildfires, and other calamities and disasters.
many localized areas are subject to human-made pollution of the air and water, acid rain and toxic substances, loss of vegetation (overgrazing, deforestation, desertification), loss of wildlife, species extinction, soil degradation, soil depletion and erosion.
there is a scientific consensus linking human activities to global warming due to industrial carbon dioxide emissions. this is predicted to produce changes such as the melting of glaciers and ice sheets, more extreme temperature ranges, significant changes in weather and a global rise in average sea levels. human geography cartography, the study and practice of map-making, and geography, the study of the lands, features, inhabitants and phenomena on earth, have historically been the disciplines devoted to depicting earth. surveying, the determination of locations and distances, and to a lesser extent navigation, the determination of position and direction, have developed alongside cartography and geography, providing and suitably quantifying the requisite information.
earth's human population reached approximately seven billion on 31 october 2011. projections indicate that the world's human population will reach 9.2 billion in 2050. most of the growth is expected to take place in developing nations. human population density varies widely around the world, but a majority live in asia. by 2020, 60% of the world's population is expected to be living in urban, rather than rural, areas.
it is estimated that one-eighth of earth's surface is suitable for humans to live on – three-quarters of earth's surface is covered by oceans, leaving one-quarter as land. half of that land area is desert (14%), high mountains (27%), or other unsuitable terrains. the northernmost permanent settlement in the world is alert, on ellesmere island in nunavut, canada. (82°28′n) the southernmost is the amundsen–scott south pole station, in antarctica, almost exactly at the south pole. (90°s) independent sovereign nations claim the planet's entire land surface, except for some parts of antarctica, a few land parcels along the danube river's western bank, and the unclaimed area of bir tawil between egypt and sudan. as of 2015, there are 193 sovereign states that are member states of the united nations, plus two observer states and 72 dependent territories and states with limited recognition. earth has never had a sovereign government with authority over the entire globe, although some nation-states have striven for world domination and failed.
the united nations is a worldwide intergovernmental organization that was created with the goal of intervening in the disputes between nations, thereby avoiding armed conflict. the u.n. serves primarily as a forum for international diplomacy and international law. when the consensus of the membership permits, it provides a mechanism for armed intervention.
the first human to orbit earth was yuri gagarin on 12 april 1961. in total, about 487 people have visited outer space and reached orbit as of 30 july 2010, and, of these, twelve have walked on the moon. normally, the only humans in space are those on the international space station. the station's crew, made up of six people, is usually replaced every six months. the farthest that humans have traveled from earth is 400,171 km, achieved during the apollo 13 mission in 1970. moon the moon is a relatively large, terrestrial, planet-like natural satellite, with a diameter about one-quarter of earth's. it is the largest moon in the solar system relative to the size of its planet, although charon is larger relative to the dwarf planet pluto. the natural satellites of other planets are also referred to as moons, after earth's.
the gravitational attraction between earth and the moon causes tides on earth. the same effect on the moon has led to its tidal locking: its rotation period is the same as the time it takes to orbit earth. as a result, it always presents the same face to the planet. as the moon orbits earth, different parts of its face are illuminated by the sun, leading to the lunar phases; the dark part of the face is separated from the light part by the solar terminator. due to their tidal interaction, the moon recedes from earth at the rate of approximately 38 mm/yr. over millions of years, these tiny modifications—and the lengthening of earth's day by about 23 µs/yr—add up to significant changes. during the devonian period, for example, (approximately 410 mya) there were 400 days in a year, with each day lasting 21.8 hours.
the moon may have dramatically affected the development of life by moderating the planet's climate. paleontological evidence and computer simulations show that earth's axial tilt is stabilized by tidal interactions with the moon. some theorists think that without this stabilization against the torques applied by the sun and planets to earth's equatorial bulge, the rotational axis might be chaotically unstable, exhibiting chaotic changes over millions of years, as appears to be the case for mars.
viewed from earth, the moon is just far enough away to have almost the same apparent-sized disk as the sun. the angular size (or solid angle) of these two bodies match because, although the sun's diameter is about 400 times as large as the moon's, it is also 400 times more distant. this allows total and annular solar eclipses to occur on earth.
the most widely accepted theory of the moon's origin, the giant-impact hypothesis, states that it formed from the collision of a mars-size protoplanet called theia with the early earth. this hypothesis explains (among other things) the moon's relative lack of iron and volatile elements and the fact that its composition is nearly identical to that of earth's crust. asteroids and artificial satellites earth has at least five co-orbital asteroids, including 3753 cruithne and 2002 aa29. a trojan asteroid companion, 2010 tk7, is librating around the leading lagrange triangular point, l4, in the earth's orbit around the sun.
the tiny near-earth asteroid 2006 rh120 makes close approaches to the earth–moon system roughly every twenty years. during these approaches, it can orbit earth for brief periods of time.
as of june 2016, there were 1,419 operational, human-made satellites orbiting earth. there are also inoperative satellites, including vanguard 1, the oldest satellite currently in orbit, and over 16,000 pieces of tracked space debris. earth's largest artificial satellite is the international space station. cultural and historical viewpoint the standard astronomical symbol of earth consists of a cross circumscribed by a circle, , representing the four corners of the world.
human cultures have developed many views of the planet. earth is sometimes personified as a deity. in many cultures it is a mother goddess that is also the primary fertility deity, and by the mid-20th century, the gaia principle compared earth's environments and life as a single self-regulating organism leading to broad stabilization of the conditions of habitability. creation myths in many religions involve the creation of earth by a supernatural deity or deities.
scientific investigation has resulted in several culturally transformative shifts in people's view of the planet. in the west, belief in a flat earth was displaced by the idea of spherical earth, credited to pythagoras in the 6th century bc. earth was further believed to be the center of the universe until the 16th century when scientists first theorized that it was a moving object, comparable to the other planets in the solar system. due to the efforts of influential christian scholars and clerics such as james ussher, who sought to determine the age of earth through analysis of genealogies in scripture, westerners before the 19th century generally believed earth to be a few thousand years old at most. it was only during the 19th century that geologists realized earth's age was at least many millions of years.
lord kelvin used thermodynamics to estimate the age of earth to be between 20 million and 400 million years in 1864, sparking a vigorous debate on the subject; it was only when radioactivity and radioactive dating were discovered in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that a reliable mechanism for determining earth's age was established, proving the planet to be billions of years old. the perception of earth shifted again in the 20th century when humans first viewed it from orbit, and especially with photographs of earth returned by the apollo program. see also outline of earth
